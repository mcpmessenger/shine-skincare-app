# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shine Skin Collective platform requires significant backend AI upgrades to improve the accuracy and personalization of skin analysis. This upgrade focuses on three core areas: correcting the AI similarity metric from L2 distance to cosine similarity, implementing race-tailored search capabilities, and improving skin type classification accuracy. The goal is to provide more accurate, personalized, and inclusive skin analysis results for users across diverse demographics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Similarity Metric Correction

**User Story:** As a user seeking skin analysis, I want the system to use the most appropriate similarity matching algorithm so that I receive more accurate and relevant skin condition matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs vector similarity search THEN it SHALL use cosine similarity instead of L2 distance
2. WHEN vectors are added to the FAISS index THEN they SHALL be L2-normalized before insertion
3. WHEN query vectors are processed THEN they SHALL be L2-normalized before search execution
4. WHEN similarity results are returned THEN they SHALL provide more accurate matches than the previous L2 distance implementation
5. IF a vector has zero magnitude THEN the system SHALL handle this edge case gracefully without errors

### Requirement 2: Race-Tailored Search Implementation

**User Story:** As a user from a specific demographic background, I want the skin analysis to consider my ethnicity and demographic information so that I receive more relevant and personalized recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides demographic information THEN the system SHALL incorporate this data into the similarity search algorithm
2. WHEN performing similarity search THEN the system SHALL retrieve demographic metadata for candidate results from the database
3. WHEN calculating final similarity scores THEN the system SHALL combine visual similarity with demographic similarity using configurable weights
4. WHEN demographic information is available THEN the system SHALL prioritize results from similar demographic groups
5. WHEN demographic information is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to visual similarity only without errors
6. WHEN returning search results THEN the system SHALL provide results that are both visually and demographically relevant

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Skin Type Classification

**User Story:** As a user seeking accurate skin analysis, I want the system to provide improved skin type classification that considers my ethnicity so that I receive more accurate skin type identification and better product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing skin type classification THEN the system SHALL use both Fitzpatrick and Monk scale classifications
2. WHEN ethnicity information is provided THEN the system SHALL apply ethnicity-based adjustments to classification results
3. WHEN classification is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for the predictions
4. WHEN ethnicity context is available THEN classification accuracy SHALL be improved compared to base classification
5. WHEN skin regions are extracted THEN the system SHALL focus on relevant facial areas for classification
6. WHEN returning classification results THEN the system SHALL include both classification scales and confidence metrics

### Requirement 4: Google Vision API Integration for Face Detection

**User Story:** As a user uploading images for skin analysis, I want the system to use professional-grade computer vision to detect and analyze facial features so that I receive accurate skin condition assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL use Google Vision API for face detection and analysis
2. WHEN faces are detected THEN the system SHALL extract facial landmarks and skin regions for analysis
3. WHEN image properties are analyzed THEN the system SHALL capture color information, brightness, and texture data
4. WHEN label detection is performed THEN the system SHALL identify skin-related features and conditions
5. WHEN API credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL authenticate securely with Google Cloud services
6. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
7. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5: Production FAISS Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vector similarity search to use production-grade FAISS implementation so that the system can handle large-scale vector operations efficiently and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use real FAISS library with IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity
2. WHEN vectors are stored THEN they SHALL be persisted to disk for durability across restarts
3. WHEN the index grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain efficient search performance
4. WHEN multiple concurrent searches occur THEN FAISS SHALL handle thread safety appropriately
5. WHEN the system restarts THEN the FAISS index SHALL be loaded from persistent storage
6. WHEN index corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and rebuild the index automatically
7. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate memory management strategies

### Requirement 6: Service Integration and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the new AI services to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure so that the upgrade doesn't disrupt current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new services are implemented THEN they SHALL integrate with existing FAISSService and SupabaseService
2. WHEN the system starts THEN all new services SHALL initialize properly with required dependencies
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL use the new enhanced services transparently
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful degradation
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unaffected during the transition
6. WHEN mock services are used THEN they SHALL provide the same interface as production services
7. WHEN transitioning from mock to production THEN the system SHALL support gradual service replacement

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want the enhanced AI features to perform efficiently so that my analysis results are delivered quickly without degraded performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector normalization is performed THEN it SHALL not significantly impact search performance
2. WHEN demographic weighting is applied THEN search response times SHALL remain within acceptable limits (< 2 seconds)
3. WHEN multiple classification models are used THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage
4. WHEN the system handles concurrent requests THEN performance SHALL scale appropriately
5. WHEN caching is applicable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for improved performance
6. WHEN Google Vision API is called THEN requests SHALL be optimized to minimize latency and cost
7. WHEN FAISS operations are performed THEN memory usage SHALL be monitored and optimized
