# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Timeout Resolution Framework is a comprehensive system designed to handle, monitor, and optimize timeout issues across all services in the Shine Skincare App backend. This framework addresses the critical challenge of long-running AI/ML inference processes, external API calls, and deployment-related timeout issues that can significantly impact user experience and system reliability.

The framework will provide intelligent timeout management, automatic fallback mechanisms, performance monitoring, and optimization strategies to ensure consistent service availability even under heavy computational loads from facial analysis, image vectorization, and similarity searches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading an image for skin analysis, I want the system to handle long-running AI processes gracefully, so that I receive either results or meaningful feedback within a reasonable timeframe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an image for analysis THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds with either results or a processing status
2. WHEN AI processing exceeds 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to asynchronous processing mode
3. WHEN processing is moved to async mode THEN the system SHALL provide a tracking ID and estimated completion time
4. IF processing fails due to timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with optimized parameters or fallback to cached results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive timeout monitoring across all services, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service call is initiated THEN the system SHALL log the start time and expected timeout threshold
2. WHEN a service call approaches 80% of its timeout limit THEN the system SHALL generate a warning alert
3. WHEN timeout events occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed metrics including service type, payload size, and system load
4. WHEN timeout patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust timeout thresholds based on historical performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic fallback mechanisms for timeout scenarios, so that the application remains functional even when primary AI services are slow or unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Vision API calls exceed timeout limits THEN the system SHALL fallback to local image analysis
2. WHEN FAISS similarity search times out THEN the system SHALL return cached similar results or simplified recommendations
3. WHEN SCIN dataset access is slow THEN the system SHALL use locally cached metadata and images
4. IF all primary services timeout THEN the system SHALL provide basic analysis using lightweight algorithms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want intelligent load balancing and resource optimization, so that timeout issues are minimized through efficient resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load exceeds 70% THEN the framework SHALL automatically scale processing resources
2. WHEN GPU resources are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize GPU-accelerated inference for faster processing
3. WHEN multiple requests are queued THEN the system SHALL implement batch processing to optimize throughput
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and resource cleanup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want transparent communication about processing status, so that I understand what's happening when analysis takes longer than expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing switches to async mode THEN the user SHALL receive real-time status updates
2. WHEN processing is delayed THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times with 90% accuracy
3. WHEN fallback mechanisms are used THEN the user SHALL be informed about reduced functionality
4. IF processing fails completely THEN the user SHALL receive clear error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want configurable timeout policies per service type, so that different AI operations can have appropriate timeout thresholds based on their complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load timeout configurations for each service type from environment variables
2. WHEN skin classification is performed THEN it SHALL use a 15-second timeout threshold
3. WHEN image vectorization is performed THEN it SHALL use a 45-second timeout threshold
4. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN it SHALL use a 30-second timeout threshold
5. IF custom timeout values are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and apply them within safe limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive logging and analytics for timeout events, so that I can analyze patterns and improve system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timeout events occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed context including request parameters, system state, and error details
2. WHEN timeout resolution strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL track their effectiveness and success rates
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate reports with actionable insights
4. WHEN system recovery occurs THEN the system SHALL log recovery time and methods used
