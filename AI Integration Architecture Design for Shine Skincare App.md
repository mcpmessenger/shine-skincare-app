# AI Integration Architecture Design for Shine Skincare App

This document outlines the proposed architecture for integrating real AI capabilities into the Shine Skincare application, focusing on image processing, skin condition detection, and leveraging the SCIN dataset for similar case analysis. The current application utilizes mock data, and this design aims to replace it with a robust, AI-driven pipeline.

## 1. Overview of the AI Pipeline

The full AI pipeline will involve several key stages:

1.  **Image Preprocessing:** Handling raw image uploads, resizing, and normalization.
2.  **Face Detection and Isolation (for selfie analysis):** Utilizing Google Vision API to identify and isolate facial regions.
3.  **Image Embedding Generation:** Extracting high-dimensional feature vectors (embeddings) from processed skin images using a pre-trained deep learning model.
4.  **Skin Condition Detection:** Using the generated embeddings to classify and localize various skin conditions.
5.  **SCIN Dataset Integration and Vector Search:** Querying the SCIN dataset for similar cases based on image embeddings and condition characteristics.
6.  **Treatment Recommendation Generation:** Providing personalized treatment recommendations based on detected conditions and similar SCIN cases.

## 2. Image Embedding Generation Process

To enable effective comparison and search within the SCIN dataset, input images will be converted into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the essential visual characteristics of the skin condition.

### 2.1 Model Selection

We will leverage a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction. Libraries like `timm` (PyTorch Image Models) or `transformers` offer a wide range of state-of-the-art models suitable for this purpose. A strong candidate would be a model pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and potentially fine-tuned on dermatological images if such a model is available or can be trained.

**Rationale:** Pre-trained models have learned rich, hierarchical features from vast amounts of image data, making them excellent feature extractors. Fine-tuning on a smaller, domain-specific dataset can further enhance their relevance to skin imagery.

### 2.2 Embedding Process

1.  **Input Image:** The raw image uploaded by the user.
2.  **Preprocessing:** The image will be resized to the input dimensions required by the chosen CNN model (e.g., 224x224 pixels), normalized (e.g., pixel values scaled to a specific range and mean/std deviation applied), and converted to a tensor format compatible with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** The preprocessed image will be fed through the pre-trained CNN model, specifically up to a layer before the final classification head. The output of this layer will be the image embedding.
4.  **Dimensionality:** The dimensionality of the embedding vector will depend on the chosen model (e.g., 512, 768, 1024, or 2048 dimensions).

## 3. Vector Search Implementation

Vector search is crucial for finding similar cases within the SCIN dataset. Given the `FAISS` library is already indicated in the backend, it will be the primary choice for this component.

### 3.1 FAISS for Efficient Similarity Search

`FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that do not fit in RAM.

**Workflow:**

1.  **SCIN Dataset Embedding:** All images within the SCIN dataset will be pre-processed and their embeddings generated using the same CNN model used for user-uploaded images. These embeddings will form the searchable index.
2.  **FAISS Index Creation:** A FAISS index will be created from the SCIN dataset embeddings. The type of index (e.g., `IndexFlatL2`, `IndexIVFFlat`, `IndexHNSWFlat`) will depend on the dataset size and performance requirements. For a dataset of 10,000+ images, an `IndexIVFFlat` or `IndexHNSWFlat` would be suitable for faster search.
3.  **Querying:** When a user uploads an image, its embedding will be generated. This query embedding will then be used to search the FAISS index for the `k` most similar embeddings from the SCIN dataset.
4.  **Result Retrieval:** FAISS will return the indices of the `k` most similar vectors, along with their similarity scores. These indices will then be mapped back to the corresponding SCIN case metadata (e.g., `case_id`, `condition_type`, `treatment_history`, `outcome`).

## 4. Google Vision API Integration for Face Detection/Isolation

For selfie analysis, accurate face detection and isolation are critical to focus the skin analysis on relevant areas and avoid distractions. The `google.cloud.vision` library is already present in the backend, indicating its intended use.

### 4.1 Face Detection Workflow

1.  **Image Submission:** The user's selfie image will be sent to the Google Vision API.
2.  **Face Detection:** The Vision API's `face_detection` feature will be used to identify bounding boxes around faces and potentially facial landmarks.
3.  **Face Isolation:** If a face is detected, the bounding box coordinates will be used to crop the image, isolating the facial region. This isolated face image will then be passed to the image embedding generation and skin condition detection pipeline.
4.  **Error Handling:** If no face is detected or multiple faces are detected (and only one is expected), appropriate error handling or user prompts will be implemented.

## 5. Data Flow for Real AI Analysis and SCIN Dataset Querying

This section describes the end-to-end data flow when a user submits an image for analysis.

```

### 5.1 Detailed Data Flow Steps:

1.  **Frontend (app/skin-analysis/page.tsx):**
    *   User selects and uploads an image.
    *   The image is sent to the backend API endpoint (`/api/v2/selfie/analyze` for selfies, `/api/v2/skin/analyze` for general skin photos).

2.  **Backend (application.py):**
    *   **Image Reception:** The Flask application receives the image file.
    *   **Image Type Determination (Implicit):** The chosen API endpoint (`/selfie/analyze` vs. `/skin/analyze`) implicitly determines if face detection is needed.
    *   **Google Vision API (for selfies):**
        *   If `GOOGLE_VISION_AVAILABLE` is true, the image is sent to Google Vision for face detection.
        *   The detected face region is cropped from the original image.
    *   **Image Preprocessing:** The (cropped) image is preprocessed (resized, normalized) for the CNN model.
    *   **Image Embedding Generation:** The preprocessed image is passed through the chosen CNN model (e.g., a `timm` model loaded with `torch`) to generate its embedding vector.
    *   **Skin Condition Detection:**
        *   A separate machine learning model (e.g., another CNN or a custom model trained on dermatological conditions) will take the image embedding (or the processed image directly) as input.
        *   This model will output predicted skin conditions, their confidence scores, and potentially bounding box locations (if object detection is integrated).
    *   **SCIN Dataset Vector Search:**
        *   The generated image embedding is used to query the pre-built FAISS index of SCIN dataset embeddings.
        *   The `k` most similar SCIN cases are retrieved, along with their similarity scores.
        *   The metadata for these similar cases (e.g., `condition_type`, `treatment_history`, `outcome`) is fetched from a database or pre-loaded data structure.
    *   **Treatment Recommendation Logic:**
        *   Based on the detected skin conditions and the insights from similar SCIN cases (especially their treatment histories and outcomes), a more intelligent treatment recommendation is generated.
        *   This could involve rule-based logic, or a more advanced recommendation system trained on historical treatment data.
    *   **Response Construction:** The backend constructs a JSON response containing:
        *   Detected `skin_conditions` (type, confidence, location, characteristics, real `scin_match_score`, `recommendation`).
        *   Real `scin_similar_cases` (id, similarity_score, condition_type, age_group, ethnicity, treatment_history, outcome).
        *   `ai_processed: True` and `ai_level: 'full_ai'`.
        *   Other relevant metadata (image size, enhanced features flags).
    *   The response is sent back to the frontend.

3.  **Frontend (app/skin-analysis/page.tsx):**
    *   Receives the JSON response from the backend.
    *   Updates the UI to display the real detected skin conditions, similar SCIN cases, and treatment recommendations.
    *   Stores the analysis result in `localStorage` with a proper `analysisId` (which will now correspond to a real analysis, not just a timestamp-based fallback).
    *   Navigates to the results page (`/analysis-results?analysisId=...`).

## 6. Key Components and Dependencies

*   **Python Libraries:**
    *   `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`: For the web server and API.
    *   `Pillow` (PIL), `NumPy`, `OpenCV`: For image loading and basic manipulation.
    *   `torch`, `timm`, `transformers`: For deep learning model inference and embedding generation.
    *   `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu`): For efficient vector similarity search.
    *   `google-cloud-vision`: For Google Vision API integration.
    *   `gcsfs`, `google-auth`, `sklearn`, `joblib`: For SCIN dataset handling and potential model loading.
*   **Google Cloud Services:**
    *   **Google Cloud Vision API:** For robust face detection and landmarking.
    *   **Google Cloud Storage:** To host the SCIN dataset (images and metadata CSVs) and potentially pre-trained models.
    *   **Google Cloud AI Platform / Vertex AI (Optional but Recommended):** For deploying and managing the skin condition detection model and potentially the embedding model as a service, allowing for scalability and MLOps practices.
*   **SCIN Dataset:** The actual dataset files (`scin_cases.csv`, `scin_labels.csv`, and image files) will need to be accessible, likely from Google Cloud Storage as indicated in the `scin_demo.ipynb`.

## 7. Challenges and Considerations

*   **Model Training/Fine-tuning:** While this design focuses on integration, acquiring or fine-tuning a robust skin condition detection model is a significant undertaking. This would require a labeled dataset of skin conditions and expertise in deep learning.
*   **Performance:** Real-time AI analysis can be computationally intensive. Optimizing model inference, FAISS search, and API response times will be crucial.
*   **Scalability:** The backend infrastructure should be designed to scale with increasing user demand, especially for image processing and AI inference.
*   **Data Privacy and Security:** Handling sensitive medical images requires strict adherence to privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA). Secure storage, transmission, and processing of data are paramount.
*   **SCIN Dataset Access:** Ensure proper authentication and authorization to access the SCIN dataset from Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Ethical AI:** Considerations around bias in AI models (e.g., performance across different skin tones) and responsible deployment of medical AI are important.

This design provides a blueprint for transforming the Shine Skincare app into a fully AI-powered skin analysis platform. The next steps will involve detailed implementation based on this architecture.




# Implementation Roadmap and Developer Instructions

This section provides a step-by-step guide for developers to implement the full AI-powered skin analysis functionality in the Shine Skincare application. It builds upon the architectural design outlined previously, focusing on practical implementation details, code examples, and integration points.

## 1. Environment Setup and Dependencies

Before diving into the code, ensure your development environment is set up with the necessary libraries and tools.

### 1.1 Python Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 1.2 Install Required Python Packages

The `application.py` file already attempts to import several AI-related libraries. You will need to install these, along with `Flask` and `Flask-CORS`.

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-Cors numpy Pillow opencv-python faiss-cpu timm transformers torch google-cloud-vision google-cloud-storage gcsfs google-auth scikit-learn joblib
```

**Note on `faiss-cpu` vs. `faiss-gpu`:** If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, consider installing `faiss-gpu` for significantly faster performance. Otherwise, `faiss-cpu` is sufficient.

**Note on `opencv-python`:** This package includes pre-built OpenCV binaries. If you encounter issues, you might need to compile OpenCV from source or use a different distribution.

### 1.3 Google Cloud SDK and Authentication

To interact with Google Cloud Vision API and Google Cloud Storage (for the SCIN dataset), you need to install and configure the Google Cloud SDK.

1.  **Install Google Cloud SDK:** Follow the official instructions for your operating system: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

2.  **Authenticate:** Once installed, authenticate your SDK. This will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account.

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    Ensure the account you use has access to the Google Cloud project where the Google Vision API is enabled and where the SCIN dataset bucket (`dx-scin-public-data`) is located.

## 2. Accessing the SCIN Dataset

The SCIN dataset is hosted on Google Cloud Storage. The `scin_demo.ipynb` notebook provides a good starting point for understanding how to access it. You will primarily need `scin_cases.csv`, `scin_labels.csv`, and the image files.

### 2.1 Download SCIN Metadata

You can download the CSV files directly from the Google Cloud Storage bucket:

```python
from google.cloud import storage

def download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name):
    """Downloads a blob from the bucket."""
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)
    blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_name)
    print(f"Blob {source_blob_name} downloaded to {destination_file_name}.")

bucket_name = "dx-scin-public-data"
download_blob(bucket_name, "dataset/scin_cases.csv", "scin_cases.csv")
download_blob(bucket_name, "dataset/scin_labels.csv", "scin_labels.csv")
```

These CSVs contain metadata about the cases and their labels, which will be crucial for mapping FAISS search results back to meaningful information.

### 2.2 Accessing SCIN Images

Images are also stored in the `dataset/images/` directory within the `dx-scin-public-data` bucket. You will need to stream these images as needed for embedding generation. The `scin_demo.ipynb` shows how to do this using `bucket.blob(image_path).download_as_string()`.

## 3. Implementing Image Embedding Generation

This involves loading a pre-trained CNN model and using it to extract features from images. We'll use `timm` for model loading and `torch` for tensor operations.

### 3.1 Choose a Pre-trained Model

For dermatological images, models like `resnet` or `efficientnet` families are good starting points. You can list available models in `timm`:

```python
import timm
print(timm.list_models(pretrained=True))
```

Let's assume we choose `resnet50` for this example.

### 3.2 Create an Image Embedding Function

Add a new function to `application.py` (or a new utility file) to generate image embeddings.

```python
import torch
import timm
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import io

def get_image_embedding(image_bytes: bytes, model_name: str = 'resnet50', device: str = 'cpu'):
    """Generates an embedding vector for an image using a pre-trained CNN.

    Args:
        image_bytes: Raw image bytes.
        model_name: Name of the pre-trained model to use (e.g., 'resnet50').
        device: 'cpu' or 'cuda' for GPU acceleration.

    Returns:
        A numpy array representing the image embedding.
    """
    model = timm.create_model(model_name, pretrained=True, num_classes=0) # num_classes=0 to get features before classification head
    model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode
    model.to(device)

    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)), # Resize to model's expected input size
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) # ImageNet normalization
    ])

    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)).convert("RGB")
    image_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device) # Add batch dimension

    with torch.no_grad():
        embedding = model(image_tensor)

    return embedding.cpu().numpy().flatten()

```

## 4. Implementing FAISS Vector Search

This section details how to build and query a FAISS index for the SCIN dataset.

### 4.1 Pre-compute SCIN Embeddings and Build FAISS Index

This is a one-time process that should be done offline or as part of a data preparation pipeline. The resulting FAISS index and metadata should be saved and loaded by the Flask application.

```python
import pandas as pd
import faiss
import numpy as np
import os
from google.cloud import storage

# --- Configuration (adjust as needed) ---
SCIN_CASES_CSV = "scin_cases.csv"
SCIN_LABELS_CSV = "scin_labels.csv"
SCIN_BUCKET_NAME = "dx-scin-public-data"
FAISS_INDEX_PATH = "scin_faiss_index.bin"
SCIN_METADATA_PATH = "scin_metadata.pkl"

def build_scin_faiss_index(model_name: str = 'resnet50', device: str = 'cpu'):
    """Pre-computes embeddings for SCIN images and builds a FAISS index.
    Saves the index and corresponding metadata.
    """
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(SCIN_BUCKET_NAME)

    cases_df = pd.read_csv(SCIN_CASES_CSV, dtype={'case_id': str})
    labels_df = pd.read_csv(SCIN_LABELS_CSV, dtype={'case_id': str})
    scin_df = pd.merge(cases_df, labels_df, on='case_id')

    embeddings = []
    case_ids = []

    for index, row in scin_df.iterrows():
        for i in range(1, 4): # Iterate through image_1_path, image_2_path, image_3_path
            image_path_col = f'image_{i}_path'
            if pd.notna(row[image_path_col]):
                image_path = row[image_path_col]
                try:
                    blob = bucket.blob(image_path)
                    image_bytes = blob.download_as_bytes()
                    embedding = get_image_embedding(image_bytes, model_name, device)
                    embeddings.append(embedding)
                    case_ids.append(row['case_id'])
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error processing image {image_path}: {e}")

    embeddings_np = np.array(embeddings).astype('float32')
    dimension = embeddings_np.shape[1]

    # Choose an appropriate FAISS index type
    # For a start, IndexFlatL2 is simple. For larger datasets, consider IndexIVFFlat or IndexHNSWFlat.
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
    index.add(embeddings_np)

    faiss.write_index(index, FAISS_INDEX_PATH)
    pd.DataFrame({'case_id': case_ids}).to_pickle(SCIN_METADATA_PATH)

    print(f"FAISS index built with {index.ntotal} vectors and saved to {FAISS_INDEX_PATH}")
    print(f"SCIN metadata saved to {SCIN_METADATA_PATH}")

# Example usage (run this once to generate the index and metadata)
# build_scin_faiss_index(device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

### 4.2 Load FAISS Index and Metadata in Flask App

Modify `application.py` to load the pre-built FAISS index and metadata when the application starts.

```python
# Add these global variables at the top of application.py
SCIN_FAISS_INDEX = None
SCIN_METADATA_DF = None

# Inside the application.py, after AI_FULL_AVAILABLE check:
if SCIN_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        import faiss
        import joblib
        import pandas as pd
        
        # Define paths (adjust if you store them elsewhere)
        FAISS_INDEX_PATH = "scin_faiss_index.bin"
        SCIN_METADATA_PATH = "scin_metadata.pkl"

        if os.path.exists(FAISS_INDEX_PATH) and os.path.exists(SCIN_METADATA_PATH):
            SCIN_FAISS_INDEX = faiss.read_index(FAISS_INDEX_PATH)
            SCIN_METADATA_DF = pd.read_pickle(SCIN_METADATA_PATH)
            logger.info("✅ FAISS index and SCIN metadata loaded successfully")
        else:
            logger.warning("❌ FAISS index or SCIN metadata not found. Run build_scin_faiss_index first.")
            SCIN_AVAILABLE = False # Disable SCIN features if data not found
    except ImportError as e:
        logger.warning(f"❌ FAISS or related libraries not available for SCIN: {e}")
        SCIN_AVAILABLE = False
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading FAISS index or SCIN metadata: {e}")
        SCIN_AVAILABLE = False

```

### 4.3 Implement SCIN Search Function

Add a function to query the FAISS index.

```python
def search_scin_similar_cases(query_embedding: np.ndarray, k: int = 5):
    """Searches the FAISS index for similar SCIN cases.

    Args:
        query_embedding: The embedding of the user's image.
        k: Number of similar cases to retrieve.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, each representing a similar SCIN case.
    """
    if SCIN_FAISS_INDEX is None or SCIN_METADATA_DF is None:
        logger.warning("SCIN FAISS index or metadata not loaded.")
        return []

    D, I = SCIN_FAISS_INDEX.search(np.array([query_embedding]).astype('float32'), k)

    similar_cases = []
    for i, distance in zip(I[0], D[0]):
        if i == -1: # No result found
            continue
        case_id = SCIN_METADATA_DF.iloc[i]['case_id']
        # Retrieve full metadata for the case_id from the original scin_df
        # (You'll need to load scin_df globally or pass it here)
        # For now, let's use a simplified mock retrieval based on case_id
        # In a real scenario, you'd query your scin_df or database for the full case details
        
        # Placeholder for actual SCIN data retrieval
        # You would typically have a more robust way to get the full case details
        # from scin_df based on case_id
        mock_case_details = {
            'id': case_id,
            'similarity_score': float(1 - (distance / SCIN_FAISS_INDEX.metric_range_arg)), # Normalize distance to similarity
            'condition_type': 'mock_condition', # Replace with actual data
            'age_group': 'mock_age', # Replace with actual data
            'ethnicity': 'mock_ethnicity', # Replace with actual data
            'treatment_history': 'mock_treatment', # Replace with actual data
            'outcome': 'mock_outcome' # Replace with actual data
        }
        # To get real data, you'd do something like:
        # real_case_data = scin_df[scin_df['case_id'] == case_id].iloc[0].to_dict()
        # And then map relevant fields to the ScinCase interface

        similar_cases.append(mock_case_details)

    return similar_cases
```

**Important:** The `mock_case_details` in `search_scin_similar_cases` needs to be replaced with actual data retrieval from the `scin_df` (which should be loaded globally alongside the FAISS index). You'll need to decide how to efficiently store and retrieve the full SCIN case metadata.

## 5. Integrating Google Vision API

The `application.py` already has `google.cloud.vision` import and mock facial features. You need to replace the mock logic with actual API calls.

### 5.1 Enable Google Vision API

Ensure the Google Vision API is enabled in your Google Cloud Project.

### 5.2 Modify `analyze_selfie` Endpoint

Update the `/api/v2/selfie/analyze` endpoint to use the real Google Vision API.

```python
from google.cloud import vision

# ... inside analyze_selfie function ...

if GOOGLE_VISION_AVAILABLE and SCIN_AVAILABLE and AI_FULL_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        image_content = file.read() # Read image bytes
        image = vision.Image(content=image_content)
        
        client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
        response = client.face_detection(image=image)
        faces = response.face_annotations

        facial_features = {
            'face_detected': len(faces) > 0,
            'face_isolated': False, # Will be true after cropping
            'landmarks': [],
            'face_bounds': {}, # Bounding box for cropping
            'isolation_complete': False
        }

        if faces:
            face = faces[0] # Assuming one face for simplicity, handle multiple if needed
            vertices = face.bounding_poly.vertices
            
            # Extract bounding box for cropping
            x_min = min(v.x for v in vertices)
            y_min = min(v.y for v in vertices)
            x_max = max(v.x for v in vertices)
            y_max = max(v.y for v in vertices)

            facial_features['face_bounds'] = {
                'x': x_min, 'y': y_min, 'width': x_max - x_min, 'height': y_max - y_min
            }
            facial_features['face_isolated'] = True
            facial_features['isolation_complete'] = True

            # Extract landmarks
            for landmark in face.landmarks:
                facial_features['landmarks'].append({
                    'type': landmark.type.name.lower(),

### 5.3 Modify `analyze_skin` Endpoint

```python
# ... inside analyze_skin function ...

if SCIN_AVAILABLE and AI_CORE_AVAILABLE:

        pil_image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_content))

        # Generate embedding for the general skin image

        ]

        # Search SCIN for similar cases using the real embedding
        scin_similar_cases = search_scin_similar_cases(image_embedding)

## 6. Frontend Considerations

The frontend (`app/skin-analysis/page.tsx`) is already designed to display the analysis results. The main changes will be in how it interacts with the backend and handles the `analysisId`.

### 6.1 `analysisId` Handling

The current `analysisId = `fallback_${Date.now()}` is a client-side timestamp. Once the backend provides real analysis results, you might want to use a unique ID generated by the backend for persistent storage or tracking.

If the backend generates a unique `analysisId` (e.g., a UUID for the analysis session), the frontend should use that ID when storing in `localStorage` and navigating to the results page.

### 6.2 Displaying Real Data

The frontend components are already structured to display `skin_conditions` and `scin_similar_cases`. Ensure that the data returned by the updated backend matches the `SkinCondition` and `ScinCase` interfaces defined in `page.tsx`.

## 7. Next Steps: Implementing Real Skin Condition Detection Model

The most significant part of replacing the mock data is integrating a real skin condition detection model. This is a complex task that typically involves:

1.  **Data Collection and Annotation:** Acquiring a large, diverse, and well-annotated dataset of skin images with corresponding condition labels and bounding box annotations.
2.  **Model Training:** Training a deep learning model (e.g., a CNN for classification or an object detection model like YOLO or Faster R-CNN) on this dataset.
3.  **Model Deployment:** Deploying the trained model as an inference service that can be called from your Flask backend. This could be done using TensorFlow Serving, PyTorch Serve, or cloud-specific solutions like Google Cloud AI Platform Prediction.

**Recommendation:** For initial implementation, you might consider using a pre-trained model from a research paper or an open-source project that focuses on dermatological image analysis, if available, and adapt it to your needs. This can significantly reduce the effort compared to training a model from scratch.

## 8. Testing

After implementing these changes, thorough testing is crucial:

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions (e.g., `get_image_embedding`, `search_scin_similar_cases`).
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the API endpoints (`/api/v2/selfie/analyze`, `/api/v2/skin/analyze`) with real image inputs.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Test the entire flow from frontend image upload to displaying results.
*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the latency and throughput of the AI analysis, especially under load.

This roadmap provides a solid foundation for transforming the Shine Skincare app into a powerful AI-driven platform. The success of the project will depend on careful implementation, robust model selection, and continuous iteration and improvement.
