This document outlines the comprehensive backend architecture for the Shine project, a sophisticated system that integrates Google OAuth for authentication, Stripe for payment processing, and Firecrawl MCP for live image browsing capabilities. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable while providing real-time image search and analysis capabilities for skincare product recommendations.

The backend system serves as the foundation for an AI-powered skincare application that can analyze user-uploaded images, search for similar images across the web, and provide personalized product recommendations. The integration of multiple third-party services requires careful orchestration to ensure seamless user experience and robust system performance.

## 2. System Overview

The Shine backend architecture follows a microservices pattern with clear separation of concerns across different functional domains. The system is built around five core services that work together to provide comprehensive functionality for user management, image processing, product recommendations, and e-commerce operations.

### 2.1 Core Services Architecture

## 3. Authentication Service Design

The Authentication Service provides secure user management through Google OAuth 2.0 integration while maintaining flexibility for future authentication methods. The service handles the complete authentication lifecycle from initial registration through session management and logout.

### 3.1 Google OAuth Integration

Google OAuth 2.0 serves as the primary authentication mechanism, providing users with a familiar and secure login experience. The integration follows the authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to ensure maximum security for both web and mobile clients.

The OAuth flow begins when users initiate login through the frontend application. The Authentication Service redirects users to Google's authorization server with appropriate scopes for profile information and email access. Upon successful authentication, Google returns an authorization code that the service exchanges for access and refresh tokens.

The service maintains user profiles by extracting information from Google's user info endpoint, including email address, display name, and profile picture. This information is stored in the local database with appropriate privacy controls and user consent management.

Token management follows security best practices with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and longer-lived refresh tokens (30 days) that are automatically rotated. All tokens are stored securely using encryption at rest and are never exposed to client applications.

### 3.2 Session Management

Session management utilizes Redis for distributed session storage, enabling horizontal scaling and fast session lookup. Sessions are created upon successful authentication and include user identification, role information, and security metadata.

Session security implements multiple layers of protection including session fixation prevention, concurrent session limits, and automatic session invalidation upon suspicious activity. The service tracks session metadata including IP addresses, user agents, and geographic locations to detect potential security threats.

Session expiration follows a sliding window approach where active sessions are automatically extended while inactive sessions expire according to configured timeouts. This balances security requirements with user convenience by maintaining sessions for active users while protecting against abandoned sessions.

### 3.3 User Profile Management

User profiles extend beyond basic authentication information to include skincare-specific preferences and settings. The service manages comprehensive user data including skin type, concerns, allergies, and product preferences while ensuring proper data privacy and consent management.

Profile data is structured to support personalization algorithms while maintaining user privacy through data minimization principles. Users have full control over their profile information with capabilities to view, edit, and delete personal data in compliance with privacy regulations.

The service implements role-based access control (RBAC) to support different user types including regular users, premium subscribers, and administrative users. Role assignments determine access to specific features and API endpoints while maintaining security boundaries.
