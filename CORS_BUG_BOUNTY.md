# üêõ CORS BUG BOUNTY - $500 REWARD (UPDATED)

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE: Post-CloudFront CORS & Mixed Content Errors**

### **üí∞ Bounty Amount: $500**
**Status**: OPEN - Complex multi-layered issue requiring comprehensive fix

---

## üìã **CURRENT ISSUE DESCRIPTION**

### **What Worked Before CloudFront**
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Successfully deployed with CORS fixes
- ‚úÖ **Endpoints**: All endpoints responding correctly
- ‚úÖ **Health Check**: `/health` returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ **Trending Products**: `/api/recommendations/trending` returns data
- ‚úÖ **CORS Headers**: Single headers working correctly

### **What Broke After CloudFront Implementation**
- ‚ùå **Mixed Content Error**: HTTPS frontend trying to access HTTP backend
- ‚ùå **CORS Errors**: `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`
- ‚ùå **413 Content Too Large**: File upload size limits not working
- ‚ùå **Environment Variables**: Still pointing to old HTTP URLs

### **Current Error Details**
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://www.shineskincollective.com/skin-analysis' 
was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 
'http://shine-backend-poc-env-new-env.eba-pwtuapns.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/v2/analyze/guest'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Access to fetch at 'https://d1kmi2r0duzr21.cloudfront.net/api/v2/analyze/guest' 
from origin 'https://www.shineskincollective.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

POST https://d1kmi2r0duzr21.cloudfront.net/api/v2/analyze/guest 
net::ERR_FAILED 413 (Content Too Large)
```

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Problem 1: Mixed Content Error**
- **Issue**: Frontend (HTTPS) trying to access HTTP backend URLs
- **Evidence**: Environment variables still contain HTTP URLs
- **Impact**: Browser blocks requests for security
- **Solution**: Ensure all backend URLs are HTTPS via CloudFront

### **Problem 2: CORS Headers Missing**
- **Issue**: CloudFront not forwarding CORS headers correctly
- **Evidence**: `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`
- **Impact**: Browser blocks cross-origin requests
- **Solution**: Fix CloudFront CORS configuration

### **Problem 3: 413 Content Too Large**
- **Issue**: File upload size limits not working through CloudFront
- **Evidence**: `413 (Content Too Large)` error on image upload
- **Impact**: Users cannot upload photos for analysis
- **Solution**: Configure CloudFront to handle large file uploads

### **Problem 4: Environment Variable Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Multiple conflicting backend URLs in environment
- **Evidence**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: 'http://shine-backend-poc-env-new-env.eba-pwtuapns.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com'`
- **Impact**: Frontend tries multiple URLs, some HTTP
- **Solution**: Clean up environment variables

## üéØ **SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Immediate Actions Needed**

#### **Step 1: Fix CloudFront CORS Configuration**
```bash
# CloudFront needs to forward CORS headers correctly
# Current issue: Headers not being forwarded from backend
```

#### **Step 2: Fix File Upload Size Limits**
```bash
# CloudFront needs to handle large file uploads
# Current issue: 413 errors on image uploads
```

#### **Step 3: Clean Environment Variables**
```bash
# Remove conflicting HTTP URLs from environment
# Ensure all URLs point to CloudFront HTTPS
```

#### **Step 4: Test End-to-End**
```bash
# Verify HTTPS throughout the entire chain
# Test file uploads up to 100MB
# Confirm CORS headers present
```

## üîß **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **CloudFront Configuration Fix**
1. **Update CORS Headers**: Ensure CloudFront forwards all CORS headers
2. **Fix File Size Limits**: Configure CloudFront for large uploads
3. **Test CORS Preflight**: Verify OPTIONS requests work

### **Environment Variable Cleanup**
1. **Remove HTTP URLs**: Clean up environment variables
2. **Force CloudFront URL**: Ensure frontend only uses HTTPS
3. **Test URL Resolution**: Verify no HTTP requests

### **Backend Verification**
1. **Test Direct Backend**: Verify backend works without CloudFront
2. **Test Through CloudFront**: Verify CloudFront proxy works
3. **Test File Uploads**: Verify 100MB uploads work

## üìû **SUPPORT RESOURCES**

### **Current Working Components**
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Deployed and responding correctly

## üéØ **FINAL STATUS**

**Current State**: 
- ‚úÖ Backend: Working correctly (direct access)
- ‚úÖ CloudFront: HTTPS proxy working
- ‚ùå CloudFront CORS: Headers not forwarded
- ‚ùå File Uploads: 413 errors
- ‚ùå Environment: Conflicting URLs

**Root Cause**: CloudFront implementation introduced CORS and file size issues

**Next Action**: Fix CloudFront configuration for CORS headers and file uploads

**Bounty Status**: OPEN - Requires CloudFront configuration fixes

---

## üîç **WHAT WE LEARNED**

### **What Worked**
- ‚úÖ Backend deployment with CORS fixes
- ‚úÖ Direct backend access works correctly
- ‚úÖ HTTPS CloudFront proxy setup
- ‚úÖ All endpoints functional

### **What Broke**
- ‚ùå CloudFront CORS header forwarding
- ‚ùå CloudFront file upload size limits
- ‚ùå Environment variable cleanup
- ‚ùå Mixed content error resolution

### **Key Insight**
The issue is **not with the backend** - it's with **CloudFront configuration**. The backend works perfectly when accessed directly, but CloudFront is not properly forwarding CORS headers and handling large file uploads.
