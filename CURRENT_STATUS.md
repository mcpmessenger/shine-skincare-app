# Shine Skincare App - Current Status

## Version 4 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Enhanced Backend API**: V4 comprehensive analysis with demographic integration
- **Face Detection**: Working with multiple detection methods (OpenCV, MediaPipe)
- **Skin Condition Analysis**: Acne and redness detection with improved algorithms
- **Product Recommendations**: AI-powered recommendations with cosine similarity
- **Frontend UI**: Modern, responsive design with dark mode support
- **Camera Integration**: Live camera feed with face detection status
- **Upload Functionality**: Image upload with face detection
- **Analysis Pipeline**: Complete V3/V4 compatibility

### 🔧 Current Issues
