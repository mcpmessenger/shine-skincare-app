# Proposal for Muse Aesthetic Studio: Revenue Restructuring and Commission Implementation

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a revised financial structure for Muse Aesthetic Studio, focusing on adjusting payment schedules for membership revenue and implementing a new commission-based profit split for add-on sales and services. The objective is to streamline financial operations, enhance transparency, and incentivize growth for both the spa and its owners. This document details the proposed changes, their financial implications, and the benefits of adoption.

## Current Revenue Model Overview

Muse Aesthetic Studio currently operates with a monthly autopay system for its memberships, totaling $3,765 per month. The revenue from these memberships is split 60/40, with 60% allocated to the spa and 40% to the owners. The current membership breakdown is as follows:

*   **Signature Muse Members:** 21 members at $145/month
*   **Express Members:** 6 members at $120/month
*   **Lash Babe Members:** (Calculated based on remaining revenue) 0 members at $65/month

Based on the provided information, the total revenue from Signature Muse and Express memberships is:

*   Signature Muse: 21 members * $145/month = $3,045
*   Express: 6 members * $120/month = $720

Total calculated revenue from these two tiers: $3,045 + $720 = $3,765. This perfectly matches the stated total monthly autopay, indicating that all current autopay revenue is accounted for by these two membership tiers. Therefore, there are currently no Lash Babe members contributing to the $3,765 monthly autopay.

## Proposed Membership Payment Schedule Adjustment

**Current System:** Monthly autopays are collected from members.

**Proposed Change:** While memberships will continue to be charged monthly, the payment distribution to the owners will shift from a single monthly payment to a bimonthly schedule. The preferred bimonthly payment dates are the 1st and 15th of each month.

**Financial Impact (Membership Revenue):**

*   **Total Monthly Autopay Revenue:** $3,765.00
*   **Owner's Monthly Share (40%):** $1,506.00
*   **Spa's Monthly Share (60%):** $2,259.00
*   **Bimonthly Payment to Owners:** $753.00 (paid on the 1st and 15th of each month)

This adjustment provides a more frequent distribution of funds to the owners, potentially improving cash flow management for them, while maintaining the existing revenue share percentages and the monthly billing cycle for members.

## Proposed Commission Structure for Add-on Sales and Services

**Current System:** Not explicitly defined, but assumed to be part of the general revenue.

**Proposed Change:** A new commission structure will be implemented for all add-on sales and services. This will be a 50/50 profit split between the owners and the spa.

**Definition of Add-on Sales and Services:** These include, but are not limited to, peels, brow services, and other similar treatments or product sales that are not part of the core membership benefits. The specific items considered 'add-ons' will be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties.

**Financial Impact (Add-on Sales and Services):**

*   **Profit Split:** 50% of the profit from each add-on sale or service will go to the owners, and 50% will go to the spa.
*   **Calculation:** The 'profit' for this split will be defined as the revenue generated from the add-on sale or service minus the direct costs associated with providing that service or product (e.g., cost of goods sold for products, direct labor costs for services if applicable).

This commission structure directly incentivizes both the spa and the owners to promote and sell add-on services and products, as both parties directly benefit from the profitability of these sales. It creates a clear and equitable system for sharing the success of these additional revenue streams.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Define 'Add-on Sales and Services':** A detailed list of all services and products that fall under the 50/50 profit split commission structure will be created and agreed upon.
2.  **Accounting System Adjustment:** The current accounting system, which automates autopays, will need to be updated to accommodate the bimonthly payments to owners for membership revenue and to track the profit from add-on sales and services for the 50/50 split.
3.  **Communication:** Clear communication will be provided to all relevant staff regarding the new commission structure and payment schedule to ensure smooth implementation and understanding.
4.  **Review Period:** A review period (e.g., 3-6 months) will be established to assess the effectiveness of the new payment schedule and commission structure, allowing for any necessary adjustments.

## Benefits of the Proposed Changes

*   **Improved Owner Cash Flow:** Bimonthly payments for membership revenue provide more frequent access to funds for the owners.
*   **Increased Incentive for Add-on Sales:** The 50/50 profit split directly motivates both the spa and owners to maximize add-on sales and services, leading to potential revenue growth.
*   **Enhanced Transparency:** Clearly defined payment schedules and commission structures will improve financial transparency for all parties.
*   **Streamlined Operations:** A well-defined system for revenue distribution can lead to more efficient financial management.

## Conclusion

This proposal offers a strategic approach to optimize Muse Aesthetic Studio's revenue distribution and incentivize growth. By implementing bimonthly payments for membership revenue and a 50/50 profit split for add-on sales and services, Muse Aesthetic Studio can foster a more financially robust and mutually beneficial environment for both the spa and its owners. We recommend a thorough discussion of these points to ensure alignment and a successful transition to the new model.
