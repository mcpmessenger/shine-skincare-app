# Deployment Architecture Strategy

## Current Issue
- Backend and frontend in same repo
- GitHub push triggers AWS Amplify frontend build unnecessarily
- Security concerns with sensitive backend code in frontend repo

## Recommended Solution: Separate Repositories

### Repository Structure
```
shine-skincare-frontend/     (AWS Amplify)
├── app/
├── components/
├── public/
└── package.json

shine-skincare-backend/      (AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
├── app/
├── requirements.txt
├── .ebextensions/
└── api.py
```

### Benefits
✅ Independent deployments
✅ Better security isolation
✅ No unnecessary frontend builds
✅ Cleaner CI/CD pipelines
✅ Separate access controls

## Alternative: Monorepo with Path-Based Deployment

### Option A: GitHub Actions with Path Filters
```yaml
# .github/workflows/backend.yml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
      - '.github/workflows/backend.yml'
```

### Option B: AWS EB Root Directory Configuration
- Set EB to only watch `backend/` directory
- Configure AWS Amplify to ignore `backend/` changes

## Security Measures Applied
- ✅ All credential files in .gitignore
- ✅ Environment variables only (no hardcoded secrets)
- ✅ Separate deployment configurations
- ✅ Service-specific access controls
