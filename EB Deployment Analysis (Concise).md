# Shine Skincare App: EB Deployment Analysis (Concise)

## 1. Executive Summary

Persistent AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) deployment failures for Shine Skincare App. Root cause: EB environment configuration mismatch (health checks, port binding), not app code or resource limits. This report details issues and provides actionable recommendations for successful deployment, including optimized EB settings, S3 integration, and instance specifications.

## 2. Problem Statement

Recurring EB deployment failures characterized by health check (HC) timeouts, `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS`, and `Failed to deploy application` errors. Even minimal app versions failed, indicating non-resource-related issues. Local fixes (missing Python modules, S3 client compatibility) enabled local app function but failed in production EB. Critical issues:
*   **EB Environment Config Mismatch**
*   **HC Endpoint Incompatibility**
*   **Port Binding Issues** (Flask on 8000)
*   **Flask App Not Responding to EB HCs**
*   **Environment-Specific Config Problems**

## 3. Analysis of Current Config & Issues

App uses `gunicorn` on port `8000` via `Procfile` (`web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:application`). `wsgi.py` correctly points to `application.py`'s Flask app. `application.py` handles S3 model download (`fixed_model_best.h5` from `shine-ml-models-2025`) and exposes HCs (`/health`, `/ready`).

**`.ebextensions` (created/recommended):**

*   **`01_port_config.config`**: Sets `PORT: 8000` (env var) and `ServicePort: 8000` (EB env) for correct traffic routing. `WSGIPath: wsgi.py` confirmed.
*   **`02_health_check.config`**: Configures HCs:
    *   `FLASK_ENV: production`
    *   `EnvironmentType: LoadBalanced`
    *   `SystemType: enhanced` (for detailed HC reporting)
    *   `Application Healthcheck URL: /health`
    *   `HealthCheckPath: /health`
    *   `MatcherHTTPCode: 200`
    *   `Port: 8000` (crucial for HC to target correct app port)
    *   `Timeout: 300` (seconds, to accommodate ML model download/startup delays).
*   **`03_python_config.config`**: `PythonVersion: 3.11` for consistency.
*   **`04_s3_config.config`**: Sets `S3_BUCKET: shine-ml-models-2025` and `S3_MODEL_KEY: fixed_model_best.h5` as env vars.

**S3 Integration**: `application.py` downloads ML model from S3, bypassing EB 512MB deployment limit. `/ready` and `/ml/health` check model availability. Debug endpoints (`/debug/download-model`, `/debug/test-s3`) are available.

**Choke Points Addressed**: The `.ebextensions` directly address port mismatch, HC timeouts, Python version consistency, and S3 env var management.

## 4. Recommendations & Solutions

### 4.1. EB Configuration Enhancements

Ensure all `.ebextensions` files (`01_port_config.config`, `02_health_check.config`, `03_python_config.config`, `04_s3_config.config`) are in `backend/.ebextensions/` before deployment. These files align port config, optimize HCs (path, timeout), standardize Python version, and secure S3 env vars.

### 4.2. Instance Type Recommendations

*   **Initial**: `t3.large` for config validation.
*   **ML Workloads (CPU-intensive)**: If sustained high CPU, consider `m5` or `c5` families (e.g., `m5.large`, `c5.large`).
*   **ML Workloads (GPU-intensive)**: If GPUs are needed, `g4dn` or `p3` families (higher cost/complexity).

**Action**: Start with `t3.large`. Monitor CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory). Scale up to `m5.large`/`c5.large` if sustained high CPU.

### 4.3. S3 Integration Best Practices

*   **Model Versioning**: Use S3 object versioning for `fixed_model_best.h5` for rollback capability.
*   **Lifecycle Policies**: Manage older model versions (e.g., transition to IA/Glacier).
*   **Pre-signed URLs**: For secure, temporary access if needed.
*   **Event Notifications**: Trigger actions (e.g., Lambda) on new model uploads.
*   **Separate Buckets**: Consider distinct S3 buckets for different data types (raw, processed, logs).

### 4.4. Health Check Strategy Refinement

*   **Readiness Probe**: Use `/ready` endpoint (checks model load) for EB to determine when instance is ready for traffic.
*   **Liveness Probe**: Use `/health` endpoint (lightweight) to check app responsiveness.
*   **Custom HCs**: Implement for critical component verification (e.g., DB, external API).

### 4.5. Logging & Monitoring

*   **CloudWatch Logs**: Verify app logs stream to CloudWatch for centralized analysis.
*   **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor CPU, Memory, Network, HTTP errors. Set alarms.
*   **App-Level Logging**: Enhance `application.py` logging for S3 interactions, ML loading, errors.

### 4.6. Deployment Process Improvements

*   **`.ebignore`**: Exclude unnecessary files from deployment bundle to reduce size and time.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement for automated build, test, deploy (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions).
*   **Blue/Green Deployments**: For zero-downtime production deployments (EB native support).

## 5. Conclusion

EB deployment failures stemmed from environment config mismatches (port binding, HCs). Proposed `.ebextensions` configurations directly address these. Strategic S3 use for models enhances deployability. Future success hinges on systematic deployment practices: careful instance selection, refined HCs, robust logging/monitoring, and CI/CD/blue/green strategies. This enables a stable, performant EB environment for the Shine Skincare App.
