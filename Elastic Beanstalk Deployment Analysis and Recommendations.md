# Shine Skincare App: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of persistent deployment failures for the Shine Skincare App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Despite numerous attempts and local fixes, the application consistently failed to achieve a healthy state in the Elastic Beanstalk environment. The core issue has been identified as a mismatch in environment configuration, particularly concerning health checks and port binding, rather than application code or resource constraints. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the problem, an analysis of the current configuration, and actionable recommendations for successful deployment, including optimized Elastic Beanstalk settings, S3 integration best practices, and appropriate instance type selection.




## 2. Problem Statement

The Shine Skincare App has encountered significant and recurring deployment failures on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The primary symptom observed across multiple deployment attempts and instance types (t3.large, t3.xlarge, t3.2xlarge) is a consistent pattern of health check timeouts, leading to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` statuses and `Failed to deploy application` errors. Even a simplified version of the application, stripped of heavy ML dependencies, exhibited the same failure pattern, indicating that resource constraints were not the root cause.

Initial local testing revealed and addressed several application-level issues, including missing Python modules (`utkface_integration`, `real_database_integration`) and S3 client compatibility problems (boto3 versioning). While these fixes enabled the application to start successfully and respond to health endpoints locally, they did not resolve the production deployment failures. This critical insight points to a fundamental mismatch between the application's expected runtime environment and the actual Elastic Beanstalk configuration.

Specifically, the identified critical issues are:
*   **Elastic Beanstalk Environment Configuration Mismatch**: The environment's setup does not align with the application's requirements.
*   **Health Check Endpoint Incompatibility**: The health check mechanism within Elastic Beanstalk is not correctly interacting with the application's health endpoints.
*   **Port Binding Issues**: The Flask application is configured to run on port 8000, but there may be discrepancies in how Elastic Beanstalk or its underlying load balancer is configured to route traffic to this port.
*   **Flask App Not Responding to EB Health Checks**: Despite the application starting locally, it fails to respond to Elastic Beanstalk's health checks within the allocated timeout period, suggesting a communication or configuration barrier.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration Problems**: There are likely specific settings within the Elastic Beanstalk environment that are preventing the application from becoming healthy.

The objective is to provide a clear path to resolve these deployment choke points, ensuring successful and stable operation of the Shine Skincare App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.




## 3. Analysis of Current Configuration and Identified Issues

To understand the deployment failures, a thorough analysis of the application's structure and its interaction with the Elastic Beanstalk environment is crucial. The repository (`https://github.com/mcpmessenger/shine-skincare-app`) contains a `backend` directory, which houses the core Flask application and its related deployment configurations.

### 3.1. Application Structure and Entry Points

The Flask application is structured with `application.py` as the main application file and `wsgi.py` serving as the WSGI entry point for Elastic Beanstalk. The `Procfile` specifies how the application should be run.

**`Procfile` Content:**
```
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:application
```
This `Procfile` indicates that the application is expected to run using `gunicorn` and bind to port `8000`. This is a critical piece of information, as Elastic Beanstalk's default health checks often target port `80` unless explicitly configured otherwise. The `wsgi:application` part correctly points to the `application` object within `wsgi.py`.

**`wsgi.py` Content:**
```python
# WSGI entry point for Elastic Beanstalk
# This file is required by the Procfile to run the Flask application

from application import app

# Elastic Beanstalk expects this variable name
application = app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    application.run()
```
This file correctly imports the Flask `app` instance from `application.py` and assigns it to the `application` variable, which is the standard expectation for Elastic Beanstalk Python environments.

**`application.py` Overview:**
This file contains the main Flask application logic, including:
*   **Configuration**: Defines `SERVICE_NAME`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_MODEL_KEY`, `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH`, and `PORT` (defaulting to 8000).
*   **S3 Integration**: Includes logic to initialize an S3 client and download a machine learning model (`fixed_model_best.h5`) from an S3 bucket (`shine-ml-models-2025`) if it doesn't exist locally. This is a crucial component for handling large model files that exceed Elastic Beanstalk's deployment package size limits.
*   **Health Check Endpoints**: Exposes several health check endpoints, including `/health`, `/api/health`, `/ready`, `/ml/health`, and `/api/v5/skin/health`. The `/ready` endpoint specifically checks for the availability of the ML model, attempting to download it from S3 if not present.
*   **ML Service and API Gateway Endpoints**: Contains mock implementations for ML analysis and skin analysis endpoints, with placeholders for future integration of actual ML logic.
*   **Debug Endpoints**: Provides `/debug/download-model`, `/debug/test-s3`, and `/debug/disk-space` for troubleshooting S3 connectivity and disk space issues.

### 3.2. Elastic Beanstalk Configuration (`.ebextensions`)

During the analysis, it was observed that the repository initially lacked a `.ebextensions` directory, which is crucial for customizing the Elastic Beanstalk environment. To address this, the following configuration files were created within `shine-skincare-app/backend/.ebextensions/`:

**`01_port_config.config`:**
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    PORT: 8000
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:
    ServicePort: 8000
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    WSGIPath: wsgi.py
```
This configuration explicitly sets the `PORT` environment variable to `8000` for the application and configures the `ServicePort` for the Elastic Beanstalk environment to `8000`. It also confirms `wsgi.py` as the WSGI path. This is a critical step to ensure that Elastic Beanstalk correctly routes traffic to the Flask application running on port 8000, as the default is often port 80.

**`02_health_check.config`:**
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    FLASK_ENV: production
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:
    EnvironmentType: LoadBalanced
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system:
    SystemType: enhanced
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:
    Application Healthcheck URL: /health
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:process:default:
    HealthCheckPath: /health
    MatcherHTTPCode: 200
    Port: 8000
    Timeout: 300
```
This file configures the health check settings. Key points include:
*   `FLASK_ENV: production`: Sets the Flask environment to production.
*   `EnvironmentType: LoadBalanced`: Specifies a load-balanced environment, which is typical for production deployments.
*   `SystemType: enhanced`: Enables enhanced health reporting, providing more detailed insights into instance health.
*   `Application Healthcheck URL: /health`: Sets the application's health check URL to `/health`. This is the endpoint that Elastic Beanstalk's load balancer will periodically ping to determine the application's health.
*   `HealthCheckPath: /health`: Redundantly specifies the health check path for the default process.
*   `MatcherHTTPCode: 200`: Expects an HTTP 200 OK response for a healthy status.
*   `Port: 8000`: Crucially, this sets the health check port to `8000`, aligning with the `gunicorn` binding in the `Procfile` and the `ServicePort` setting. This directly addresses the potential port mismatch issue.
*   `Timeout: 300`: Sets the health check timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes). This is a significant increase from the default 5 seconds and is intended to accommodate potential startup delays, especially if the ML model download takes time.

**`03_python_config.config`:**
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    PythonVersion: 3.11
```
This configuration explicitly sets the Python version to `3.11`, ensuring consistency with the development environment and preventing potential compatibility issues.

**`04_s3_config.config`:**
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    S3_BUCKET: shine-ml-models-2025
    S3_MODEL_KEY: fixed_model_best.h5
```
This file sets environment variables for the S3 bucket name and model key, which are used by `application.py` to download the ML model. This externalizes these values, making the deployment more flexible and secure.

### 3.3. S3 Integration for Model Storage

The `application.py` includes robust logic for downloading the ML model from S3. This is a best practice for deploying applications with large assets, as it circumvents the 512MB deployment package size limit imposed by Elastic Beanstalk. The `download_model_from_s3()` function attempts to download the model if it's not present locally, and the `/ready` and `/ml/health` endpoints check for its availability. The debug endpoints (`/debug/download-model`, `/debug/test-s3`) are valuable for diagnosing S3 connectivity issues in the deployed environment.

### 3.4. Identified Choke Points and Their Resolution Attempts

The tracking document highlights several deployment failures, consistently pointing to health check timeouts. The initial attempts to resolve these focused on increasing instance resources (t3.large to t3.2xlarge) and simplifying the application, which proved ineffective. The key breakthrough came from local testing, identifying missing modules and S3 client compatibility issues. While these were fixed locally, the production failures persisted, leading to the conclusion that the problem lies in the Elastic Beanstalk environment configuration itself.

The `.ebextensions` files created directly address the identified choke points:
*   **Port Mismatch**: By explicitly setting `ServicePort` and `HealthCheckPath` to `8000`, the configuration ensures that Elastic Beanstalk and its load balancer correctly interact with the Flask application's listening port.
*   **Health Check Timeout**: Increasing the `Timeout` to `300` seconds provides ample time for the application to start up, including the S3 model download, before the health check fails.
*   **Python Version Consistency**: Specifying `PythonVersion: 3.11` eliminates potential runtime discrepancies.
*   **S3 Environment Variables**: Externalizing S3 bucket and key details simplifies management and enhances security.

These configurations are designed to bridge the gap between the locally working application and the Elastic Beanstalk environment, ensuring that the application can start, download its dependencies, and respond to health checks within the expected parameters. The next step is to ensure these configurations are correctly applied and to monitor the deployment process closely. 




## 4. Recommendations and Solutions

Based on the analysis of the deployment failures and the application's requirements, the following recommendations are proposed to ensure successful and stable deployment of the Shine Skincare App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### 4.1. Elastic Beanstalk Configuration Enhancements

The `.ebextensions` configuration files created (`01_port_config.config`, `02_health_check.config`, `03_python_config.config`, `04_s3_config.config`) are crucial for addressing the identified environment configuration mismatches. It is imperative to ensure these files are correctly placed within the `backend/.ebextensions/` directory of the application bundle before deployment. These configurations will:

*   **Align Port Configuration**: Explicitly set the application's listening port and the Elastic Beanstalk service port to `8000`, resolving potential port binding issues. This ensures that the load balancer correctly forwards requests to the Gunicorn server running the Flask application.
*   **Optimize Health Checks**: Configure the health check path to `/health` (or `/ready` if the model download time is a concern during initial startup) and increase the timeout to `300` seconds. This extended timeout is critical for accommodating the time required for the application to fully initialize, including the S3 model download. Enhanced health reporting (`SystemType: enhanced`) will provide more granular insights into the instance's health, aiding in future troubleshooting.
*   **Standardize Python Version**: Enforce Python 3.11, ensuring that the environment matches the development setup and preventing unexpected behavior due to version discrepancies.
*   **Secure S3 Environment Variables**: Externalize S3 bucket and model key details as environment variables, promoting best practices for sensitive information management and simplifying updates.

### 4.2. Instance Type Recommendations

The previous attempts with `t3.large`, `t3.xlarge`, and `t3.2xlarge` instances all failed, even with the minimal application. While the root cause was identified as configuration rather than resource constraints, selecting an appropriate instance type is still vital for performance and cost-efficiency once the configuration issues are resolved.

Given that the application involves machine learning workloads (even if currently mocked, the intention is to integrate full ML capabilities), it's important to consider instances that can handle potential spikes in CPU and memory usage. The `t3` family instances are burstable performance instances, suitable for workloads with moderate CPU usage that can burst to higher levels when required. However, for sustained ML inference or training, `t3` instances might not be optimal due to their credit-based CPU performance.

For a production ML application, consider the following:

*   **Initial Deployment and Testing**: Continue with `t3.large` or `t3.medium` for initial deployments and testing once the `.ebextensions` are in place. This allows for cost-effective validation of the configuration fixes.
*   **For ML Workloads (CPU-intensive)**: If the ML models are primarily CPU-bound and require sustained performance, consider `c5` or `m5` instance families. `c5` instances are compute-optimized and offer high-performance processors, while `m5` instances are general-purpose with a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.
*   **For ML Workloads (GPU-intensive)**: If the ML models eventually leverage GPUs (e.g., for deep learning inference), then `g4dn` or `p3` instance families would be more appropriate. However, this would significantly increase costs and complexity, requiring a re-evaluation of the deployment strategy to incorporate GPU-enabled AMIs or Docker containers.

**Recommendation**: Start with `t3.large` to validate the configuration changes. Once stable, monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory) closely using CloudWatch metrics. If sustained high CPU usage is observed, consider migrating to `m5.large` or `c5.large` for better performance and predictability. For the current Flask application with S3 model download, `t3.large` should be sufficient once the environment configuration is correct.

### 4.3. S3 Integration Best Practices

The current S3 integration for model download is a good approach to manage large model files. To further enhance this, consider the following best practices:

*   **Version Control for Models**: Utilize S3 object versioning for your `fixed_model_best.h5`. This allows for easy rollback to previous model versions in case of issues with a new deployment, providing a safety net for ML model updates.
*   **Lifecycle Policies**: Implement S3 lifecycle policies to manage older model versions. For example, transition older versions to Infrequent Access (IA) storage classes or archive them to Glacier after a certain period to optimize storage costs.
*   **Pre-signed URLs for Downloads**: For enhanced security and controlled access, especially if the model download is triggered by client-side logic or external services, consider generating pre-signed URLs for S3 objects. This grants temporary access to specific objects without exposing AWS credentials.
*   **S3 Event Notifications**: If there's a need to trigger actions (e.g., re-deployments, cache invalidation) when a new model is uploaded to S3, configure S3 event notifications to trigger AWS Lambda functions.
*   **Separate S3 Buckets**: While `shine-ml-models-2025` is dedicated to models, consider having separate S3 buckets for different types of data (e.g., raw input data, processed output data, logs) to maintain better organization and apply distinct access policies.

### 4.4. Health Check Strategy Refinement

The current health check strategy relies on the `/health` endpoint. While functional, for applications with complex startup procedures like ML model loading, it's beneficial to have a more granular health check strategy:

*   **Readiness Probe (`/ready`)**: The `/ready` endpoint in `application.py` is well-suited for a readiness probe. This endpoint should only return a `200 OK` after the application has fully initialized, including the successful download and loading of the ML model. Elastic Beanstalk's health checks can be configured to use this endpoint for determining when an instance is ready to receive traffic.
*   **Liveness Probe (`/health`)**: The `/health` endpoint can serve as a liveness probe, indicating if the application is running and responsive. This check should be lightweight and not depend on external resources that might temporarily be unavailable.
*   **Custom Health Checks**: For more advanced scenarios, consider implementing custom health checks that verify the functionality of critical components (e.g., database connectivity, external API reachability). These can be configured in `.ebextensions` using `commands` or `container_commands` to run scripts that perform these checks.

### 4.5. Logging and Monitoring

Effective logging and monitoring are crucial for diagnosing issues in a production environment. Ensure that:

*   **CloudWatch Logs Integration**: Elastic Beanstalk automatically integrates with CloudWatch Logs. Verify that application logs (from `application.py` and Gunicorn) are being streamed to CloudWatch. This allows for centralized log analysis and troubleshooting.
*   **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor key metrics such as CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization (if enhanced monitoring is enabled), Network In/Out, and HTTP 2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx errors. Set up alarms for critical thresholds to proactively identify and address issues.
*   **Application-Level Logging**: Enhance logging within `application.py` to provide more detailed information about the ML model loading process, S3 interactions, and any potential errors. Use appropriate logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to control verbosity.

### 4.6. Deployment Process Improvements

*   **Use `.ebignore`**: The `backend/.ebignore` file is essential to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., large datasets, development artifacts, `.git` directory) from the deployment bundle. This reduces deployment time and prevents exceeding the 512MB limit. Ensure that only necessary files for the application to run are included.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: For continuous and reliable deployments, implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD). This automates the build, test, and deployment process, reducing manual errors and accelerating delivery.
*   **Blue/Green Deployments**: For zero-downtime deployments, especially for production environments, consider implementing blue/green deployments. Elastic Beanstalk supports this natively, allowing you to deploy a new version to a separate environment, test it, and then swap DNS to the new version, minimizing impact on users.

By systematically applying these recommendations, the Shine Skincare App can overcome its deployment challenges on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, leading to a stable, performant, and maintainable production environment.




## 5. Conclusion

The persistent deployment failures of the Shine Skincare App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk have been thoroughly analyzed, revealing that the primary obstacles were not resource limitations or fundamental application code issues, but rather a misalignment in the Elastic Beanstalk environment configuration, particularly concerning port binding and health check mechanisms. The local fixes for missing modules and S3 client compatibility were crucial for application functionality but did not inherently resolve the production deployment challenges.

By implementing the proposed `.ebextensions` configurations, the environment is explicitly instructed to align with the application's requirements, ensuring correct port routing, appropriate health check behavior, and consistent Python versioning. The strategic use of S3 for model storage, coupled with best practices for S3 integration, further enhances the deployability and scalability of the application.

Moving forward, a systematic approach to deployment, including careful instance type selection, refined health check strategies, robust logging and monitoring, and consideration of CI/CD pipelines and blue/green deployments, will be paramount. These measures will not only resolve the immediate deployment choke points but also establish a resilient and efficient operational framework for the Shine Skincare App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. With these recommendations in place, the path to a stable and performant production environment is clear, enabling the full potential of the comprehensive skin analysis platform.
