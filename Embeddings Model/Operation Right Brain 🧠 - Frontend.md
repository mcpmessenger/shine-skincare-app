## 2. Feature Details

### 2.1. AI-Powered Skin Analysis Integration

#### 2.1.1. User Flow

1.  User navigates to the skin analysis section.
2.  User uploads a selfie image (or takes a photo).
3.  Frontend sends the image to the new backend API endpoint for processing.
4.  Frontend displays a loading indicator while analysis is in progress.
5.  Upon receiving results from the backend, the frontend displays the skin analysis report, including relevant information from the SCIN dataset comparison.

#### 2.1.2. Requirements

*   **FR1**: The frontend shall allow users to upload image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) for skin analysis.
*   **FR2**: The frontend shall display a clear and informative loading state during image upload and AI processing.
*   **FR3**: The frontend shall consume the new backend API endpoint for image analysis (`/api/v3/skin/analyze-enhanced` or similar).
*   **FR4**: The frontend shall parse and display the skin analysis results received from the backend, including:
    *   Identified skin conditions.
    *   Similarity scores to SCIN dataset entries.
    *   Relevant images and descriptions from the SCIN dataset.
    *   Personalized product recommendations.
*   **FR5**: The frontend shall handle and display error messages gracefully in case of API failures or invalid inputs.
*   **FR6**: The frontend shall ensure image uploads are optimized for size and quality before sending to the backend.

### 2.2. Dark Mode Implementation

#### 2.2.1. User Flow

1.  User accesses the application settings.
2.  User locates the 



#### 2.2.2. Requirements

*   **FR7**: The frontend shall provide a toggle mechanism (e.g., a switch in settings) to enable/disable dark mode.
*   **FR8**: The frontend shall apply dark mode styles consistently across all UI components (buttons, text, backgrounds, forms, etc.).
*   **FR9**: The frontend shall persist the user's dark mode preference across sessions (e.g., using local storage).
*   **FR10**: The frontend shall ensure all images and media assets are visually compatible with both light and dark themes. This may involve using different image assets or applying CSS filters.
*   **FR11**: The frontend shall maintain sufficient color contrast for readability in dark mode, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
*   **FR12**: The frontend shall ensure that third-party components or embedded content (if any) are also styled appropriately for dark mode, or provide graceful fallbacks.

### 2.3. General UI/UX Enhancements

#### 2.3.1. Requirements

*   **FR13**: The frontend shall provide clear visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
*   **FR14**: The frontend shall be fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **FR15**: The frontend shall ensure fast loading times and smooth transitions between pages.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1. Core Technologies

*   **Framework**: Next.js 14+
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand (to be decided by development team)
*   **API Communication**: Fetch API or Axios

### 3.2. Integration Points

*   **Backend API**: Consumption of RESTful APIs exposed by the backend for skin analysis.
*   **Google Vision API**: Indirect interaction via backend for face isolation.
*   **Google Cloud Vertex AI Multimodal Embeddings**: Indirect interaction via backend for image embedding.

### 3.3. Performance & Optimization

*   **Image Optimization**: Implement Next.js Image component for optimized image loading and serving.
*   **Code Splitting**: Utilize Next.js automatic code splitting to load only necessary code for each page.
*   **Caching**: Implement client-side caching strategies for static assets and API responses where appropriate.

### 3.4. Security

*   **Input Validation**: Implement client-side input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Communication**: Ensure all communication with the backend is over HTTPS.

## 4. Success Criteria

### 4.1. Functional Success

*   **AI Integration**: Users can successfully upload images, receive analysis results, and view SCIN dataset comparisons without errors.
*   **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle dark mode on/off, and the preference persists. All UI elements render correctly in both themes.

### 4.2. Performance Success

*   **Image Upload & Analysis**: Image upload and analysis results display within 5 seconds (excluding network latency).
*   **Page Load Time**: Initial page load time (LCP) under 2.5 seconds on mobile devices.
*   **Theme Switch**: Dark mode toggle is instantaneous with no noticeable lag.

### 4.3. User Acceptance

*   User surveys indicate high satisfaction with the new skin analysis feature and the dark mode option.
*   No critical UI/UX bugs reported post-launch.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **Advanced Image Editing**: Implement basic image editing tools (cropping, rotation) within the frontend before upload.
*   **User Profiles**: Allow users to save their analysis history and preferences.
*   **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications for analysis completion or new recommendations.
*   **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages for a global user base.
