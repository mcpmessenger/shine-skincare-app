# 🚀 Migration Quick Start Guide

## **Current Status: Ready to Begin Migration**

Your current backend is **successfully deployed** and working. This guide will help you start the migration to the new Embeddings Model architecture.

---

## 📋 **Pre-Migration Checklist**

### ✅ **Current System Status**
- [x] Backend deployed successfully (`shine-backend-v54.zip`)
- [x] Health endpoint returning correct format
- [x] All AI features working
- [x] AWS region configured (us-east-1)

### 🔄 **Migration Preparation**
- [ ] Review migration plan (`MIGRATION_PLAN.md`)
- [ ] Set up new environments
- [ ] Prepare new architecture code
- [ ] Set up monitoring

---

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Environment Setup (Week 1)**

### **Step 1: Set Up New Environments**
```powershell
# Run the migration setup script
.\scripts\migration-setup.ps1
```

This will create:
- ✅ New Elastic Beanstalk application: `shine-skincare-new`
- ✅ New environment: `shine-new-staging`
- ✅ New Amplify app: `shine-frontend-new`
- ✅ CloudWatch monitoring dashboard

### **Step 2: Deploy New Backend**
```powershell
# Navigate to Embeddings Model directory
cd "Embeddings Model"

# Create deployment package
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Exclude __pycache__,.git | Compress-Archive -DestinationPath "../new-backend-v1.0.0.zip" -Force

# Deploy to new environment
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version `
  --application-name shine-skincare-new `
  --version-label v1.0.0-staging `
  --source-bundle S3Bucket="shine-deployments",S3Key="new-backend-v1.0.0.zip" `
  --region us-east-1
```

### **Step 3: Deploy New Frontend**
```powershell
# Deploy to Amplify staging branch
aws amplify create-branch `
  --app-id <amplify-app-id> `
  --branch-name staging `
  --region us-east-1
```

---

## 🧪 **Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 3-4)**

### **Step 1: Enable 5% Traffic**
```powershell
# Enable new architecture with 5% traffic
.\scripts\traffic-routing.ps1 -EnableNewArchitecture -NewArchitecturePercentage 5
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Performance**
```powershell
# Check status
.\scripts\traffic-routing.ps1 -ShowStatus

# Monitor CloudWatch dashboard
# URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=Shine-Migration-Monitoring
```

### **Step 3: Collect Feedback**
- Monitor user satisfaction
- Track error rates
- Compare response times
- Analyze cost differences

---

## 📈 **Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Week 5-6)**

### **Step 1: Increase to 25% Traffic**
```powershell
.\scripts\traffic-routing.ps1 -NewArchitecturePercentage 25
```

### **Step 2: Increase to 75% Traffic**
```powershell
.\scripts\traffic-routing.ps1 -NewArchitecturePercentage 75
```

### **Step 3: Monitor and Optimize**
- Monitor system performance
- Collect user feedback
- Optimize based on metrics

---

## 🎉 **Phase 4: Full Migration (Week 7-8)**

### **Step 1: Complete Migration**
```powershell
.\scripts\traffic-routing.ps1 -NewArchitecturePercentage 100
```

### **Step 2: Cleanup**
```powershell
# Decommission old environment (after 48 hours of monitoring)
aws elasticbeanstalk terminate-environment `
  --environment-name SHINE-env `
  --region us-east-1
```

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Immediate Rollback (0-1 hour)**
```powershell
.\scripts\rollback-emergency.ps1 -Immediate
```

### **Gradual Rollback (1-24 hours)**
```powershell
.\scripts\rollback-emergency.ps1 -Gradual
```

### **Full Rollback (24+ hours)**
```powershell
.\scripts\rollback-emergency.ps1 -Full
```

---

## 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- **Response Time**: Should be < 2 seconds
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%
- **User Satisfaction**: Should maintain or improve
- **Cost per Request**: Should decrease with new architecture

### **CloudWatch Dashboard**
- **URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=Shine-Migration-Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Application requests, latency, error rates
- **Alerts**: Set up for performance degradation

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Technical Success**
- ✅ Response time < 2 seconds
- ✅ Error rate < 1%
- ✅ 99.9% uptime
- ✅ Feature parity achieved

### **Business Success**
- ✅ User satisfaction maintained or improved
- ✅ No revenue impact
- ✅ Reduced operational costs
- ✅ Improved development velocity

---

## 📞 **Support & Communication**

### **Weekly Status Updates**
- Send to all stakeholders
- Include performance metrics
- Highlight any issues or concerns

### **Daily Monitoring (During Critical Phases)**
- Monitor CloudWatch dashboard
- Check error rates
- Review user feedback

### **Immediate Alerts**
- System performance issues

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Zero Downtime**: The migration maintains your current working system
- **Rollback Capability**: You can rollback at any time
- **Gradual Approach**: Traffic is migrated slowly to minimize risk
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring ensures issues are caught early
