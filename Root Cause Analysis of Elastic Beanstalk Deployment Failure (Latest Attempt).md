# Root Cause Analysis of Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Failure (Latest Attempt)

## Problem Statement

The Elastic Beanstalk environment is in a "Degraded" state, and the deployment ultimately failed, despite the application bundle being successfully extracted and dependencies seemingly installed. The `web.stdout.log` indicates that Gunicorn started and is listening on the expected port.

## Log Analysis

From `eb-engine.log`:

*   `2025/07/30 02:54:08.930182 [INFO] finished extracting /opt/elasticbeanstalk/deployment/app_source_bundle to /var/app/staging/ successfully`
    *   This confirms that the previous issue with backslashes in the ZIP file has been resolved, and the application bundle is now being extracted correctly.
*   `2025/07/30 02:54:08.930753 [INFO] No dependency file found`
    *   This is a critical line. It indicates that `requirements.txt` was not found in the expected location within the extracted application bundle. This would lead to Python dependencies not being installed, even if the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command was attempted.
*   `2025/07/30 02:54:08.930772 [INFO] creating default Procfile...`
    *   This is also concerning. If a `Procfile` was provided in the bundle, Elastic Beanstalk should detect and use it. The fact that it's creating a *default* `Procfile` suggests that the provided `Procfile` was either missing or not in the root of the application bundle, or still had some subtle formatting issue that caused it to be ignored.

From `web.stdout.log`:

*   `Jul 30 02:54:11 ip-172-31-35-21 web[2808]: [2025-07-30 02:54:11 +0000] [2808] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0`
*   `Jul 30 02:54:11 ip-172-31-35-21 web[2808]: [2025-07-30 02:54:11 +0000] [2808] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (2808)`
    *   These lines confirm that Gunicorn *did* start and is listening on port 8000. However, if dependencies are missing, the application itself might not be fully functional, even if the web server is running.

## Root Cause

The primary root cause of this deployment failure is the **missing or incorrectly placed `requirements.txt` and/or `Procfile` within the application source bundle**. Elastic Beanstalk's Python platform relies heavily on these files being present and correctly formatted in the root of the deployed application directory (`/var/app/staging/` or `/var/app/current/`).

*   **`requirements.txt` not found**: This is explicitly stated in the logs. Without `requirements.txt`, critical Python packages like Flask, Flask-CORS, gunicorn, numpy, and PIL (Pillow) will not be installed. This will lead to runtime errors when the application attempts to import or use these packages.
*   **`Procfile` being defaulted**: If Elastic Beanstalk creates a default `Procfile`, it means the one provided in the bundle was either not found or was unreadable/invalid. While Gunicorn still started (likely due to a default command), it might not be running the intended application or with the correct configurations (e.g., `simple_server_basic.py`).

## Impact

Without the correct `requirements.txt`, the Python application will fail to run due to missing dependencies. Even if Gunicorn starts, the Flask application (`simple_server_basic.py`) will not be able to import necessary modules, leading to internal server errors (500s) when requests are made. The application will appear 


to be deployed but will not function correctly, leading to a degraded health status.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, ensure that both `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` are correctly included in the **root directory** of the application source bundle (`.zip` file) that is uploaded to Elastic Beanstalk.

1.  **Verify `requirements.txt` inclusion**: Double-check the process used to create the `.zip` deployment package. Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the top-level directory of the `.zip` file, not nested within a subdirectory (e.g., `backend/requirements.txt`).
2.  **Verify `Procfile` inclusion**: Similarly, ensure `Procfile` is directly in the root of the `.zip` file.
3.  **Re-create the deployment package**: After confirming the presence and correct placement of these files in your local project structure, re-create the `.zip` file, making sure the zipping command or tool includes these files at the root level of the archive.

By ensuring these critical configuration files are correctly bundled, Elastic Beanstalk will be able to install dependencies and run the application as intended, leading to a successful deployment and a healthy environment.
