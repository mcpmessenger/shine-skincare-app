# Root Cause Analysis of Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Failure

## Problem Statement

The Elastic Beanstalk deployment failed with an `unzip` error, specifically stating "/opt/elasticbeanstalk/deployment/app_source_bundle appears to use backslashes as path separators". This indicates that the application source bundle (the `.zip` file) was created with Windows-style path separators (`\`) instead of Unix-style path separators (`/`), which are required by the Linux-based Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Log Analysis

The critical error message from `eb-engine.log` is:

```
2025/07/30 03:43:15.237693 [ERROR] An error occurred during execution of command [app-deploy] - [StageApplication]. Stop running the command. Error: Command /usr/bin/unzip -q -o /opt/elasticbeanstalk/deployment/app_source_bundle -d /var/app/staging/ failed with error exit status 1. Stderr:warning:  /opt/elasticbeanstalk/deployment/app_source_bundle appears to use backslashes as path separators
```

This error occurs during the `StageApplication` phase, where Elastic Beanstalk attempts to extract the uploaded application source bundle to the `/var/app/staging/` directory. The `unzip` utility, which is a standard Linux command, encountered an issue with the path separators within the `.zip` file.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the deployment failure is the **incorrect path separator usage within the application source bundle (`.zip` file)**. When the `.zip` file was created, likely on a Windows operating system, it used backslashes (`\`) to delineate directories and files within the archive. However, the Elastic Beanstalk environment runs on Linux, which expects forward slashes (`/`) as path separators. The `unzip` command on Linux is unable to correctly interpret or extract files from an archive that uses backslashes, leading to the deployment failure.

## Impact

This issue prevents the application from being successfully deployed to the Elastic Beanstalk environment, rendering any new code changes or updates ineffective. This directly impacts the ability to deploy the bug fixes for CORS and file size limits, as well as the planned ML features (Google Vision API and FAISS integration).

## Resolution

The immediate resolution is to ensure that the application source bundle is created with **forward slashes (`/`) as path separators**. This can be achieved by:

1.  **Creating the `.zip` file on a Linux/Unix-like environment**: If possible, create the deployment package on a Linux machine or within a Linux subsystem (e.g., WSL on Windows). Standard `zip` commands on these systems will use forward slashes.
2.  **Using a cross-platform compatible zipping tool**: If zipping on Windows is unavoidable, use a tool or a programming language's zip library that explicitly supports or defaults to Unix-style path separators for archives. For example, Python's `zipfile` module can be used to create archives with correct path separators.

By addressing this fundamental issue with the source bundle's structure, subsequent deployments should proceed without the `unzip` error, allowing the application to be correctly staged and deployed on Elastic Beanstalk.
