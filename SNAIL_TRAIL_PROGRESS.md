## 🚀 **PHASE 4 DETAILED PROGRESS**

### **Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Enhanced ML Service**: Built and deployed successfully
- ✅ **Container Optimization**: Multi-stage builds with performance enhancements
- ✅ **ECR Deployment**: Container pushed and task definition registered
- ✅ **ECS Service Update**: Service updated to Task Definition 12
- ✅ **Health Status**: Enhanced ML service running and healthy
- ✅ **Security Groups**: Port 5000 access configured correctly
- ✅ **VPC DNS Configuration**: Hostnames and support enabled
- ✅ **Route Table Association**: Fixed subnet association with main route table

### **Current Challenge:**
- 🔍 **Network Configuration**: Public IP assignment not working despite complete VPC configuration
- 🔍 **VPC Investigation**: Comprehensive analysis completed with all guidance implemented
- 🔍 **Solution Attempt**: All recommended VPC fixes applied without success

### **Investigation Results:**
- ✅ **Subnet Configuration**: `MapPublicIpOnLaunch: True` (correct)
- ✅ **Route Tables**: Internet gateway routes present and subnet associated (correct)
- ✅ **ECS Service**: `assignPublicIp: "ENABLED"` (correct)
- ✅ **VPC DNS**: `enableDnsHostnames: true`, `enableDnsSupport: true` (correct)
- ❌ **Root Cause**: Issue deeper than standard VPC configuration

### **Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] **Alternative Network Strategy**: Investigate different approaches
- [ ] **AWS Account Check**: Verify account-level restrictions
- [ ] **Focus on Other Objectives**: Continue with Phase 4 non-network tasks
- [ ] **Enhanced ML Service**: Validate all ML endpoints and functionality
- [ ] **Production Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Implement additional security measures
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize ML service performance
- [ ] **End-to-End Validation**: Complete production readiness testing
