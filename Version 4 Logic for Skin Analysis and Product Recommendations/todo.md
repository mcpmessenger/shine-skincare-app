## Todo List

### Phase 1: Analyze current codebase and system architecture
- [x] Review the `backend` directory for skin analysis logic and data handling.
- [x] Review the `app` directory for frontend interaction with the backend and display of results.
- [x] Identify specific files related to face detection, feature extraction, and condition detection.

### Phase 2: Research skin analysis datasets and methodologies
- [x] Research publicly available, population-accurate skin condition datasets suitable for product recommendation (not diagnosis).
- [x] Investigate best practices for face detection and isolation for scientific analysis.
- [x] Explore methods for generating robust and representative facial embeddings.
- [x] Research integration of Fitzpatrick scale, age, and ethnicity as variables in skin analysis.

### Phase 3: Design improved system architecture
- [x] Propose a revised data pipeline for image processing, face detection, and embedding generation.
- [x] Design an improved skin analysis module incorporating population-accurate data and demographic variables.
- [x] Outline the integration of a robust product recommendation engine.

### Phase 4: Create implementation recommendations and best practices
- [x] Provide detailed recommendations for dataset acquisition and preprocessing.
- [x] Suggest specific algorithms or libraries for face detection, feature extraction, and classification.
- [x] Recommend best practices for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- [x] Advise on handling and mitigating bias in AI models related to skin analysis.

### Phase 5: Deliver comprehensive analysis and recommendations
- [ ] Compile all findings, designs, and recommendations into a comprehensive report.
- [ ] Present the report to the user.
