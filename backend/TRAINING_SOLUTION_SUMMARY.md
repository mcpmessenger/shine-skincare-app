    layers.Dropout(0.6),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', 
                kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)),
    layers.Dropout(0.6),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu',
                kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)),
    layers.Dropout(0.6),
    layers.Dense(13, activation='softmax')  # 13 conditions
])
