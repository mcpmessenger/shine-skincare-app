# Conservative AI Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T05:12:08.287267

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy with conservative AI services while building on proven stable approach

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Conservative AI models (gradual loading)
- Core AI libraries (NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow)
- Optional heavy AI libraries (FAISS, TIMM, Transformers)
- Graceful fallback to mock services
- Builds on proven stable approach

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Conservative AI services
- requirements.txt: Conservative AI dependencies
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration
- .ebextensions: Conservative configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for AI model loading
3. Test conservative AI services

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Core AI libraries load successfully
- Optional AI libraries load if available
- Graceful fallback to mock services
- Conservative analysis working
- Enhanced stability

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Build on proven stable approach
Load AI libraries gradually
Provide graceful fallbacks
Monitor performance and stability
