# Gradual AI Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T05:54:48.923324

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy AI capabilities gradually, starting with minimal libraries

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Step 1: Core AI (NumPy, Pillow)
- Step 2: Heavy AI (OpenCV) - if Step 1 works
- Step 3: Full AI (FAISS, TIMM, Transformers) - if Step 2 works
- Optimized for m5.2xlarge (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
- Gradual fallback approach

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Gradual AI loading with fallbacks
- requirements.txt: Minimal AI dependencies (Step 1)
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration (1 worker, 60s timeout)
- .ebextensions: m5.2xlarge configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for successful deployment
3. Verify core AI libraries working
4. Gradually add more AI libraries

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Environment deploys successfully
- Core AI libraries load without errors
- Gradual AI analysis completing
- Memory usage within 32GB limits

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Start with minimal AI libraries
Gradually add more complex libraries
Use fallback approach for stability
Monitor each step carefully
