# Level 2 AI Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T06:07:52.809174

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy Level 2 AI capabilities with heavy libraries (FAISS, TIMM, Transformers)

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Core AI: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV (proven working)
- Level 2 AI: FAISS, TIMM, Transformers, PyTorch (NEW)
- Optimized for m5.2xlarge (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
- Enhanced AI analysis capabilities

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Level 2 AI capabilities with fallbacks
- requirements.txt: Heavy AI dependencies enabled
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration (1 worker, 120s timeout)
- .ebextensions: m5.2xlarge configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for successful deployment
3. Verify Level 2 AI libraries working
4. Test enhanced analysis features

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Environment deploys successfully
- Level 2 AI libraries load without errors
- Enhanced analysis completing
- Memory usage within 32GB limits

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Build on proven core AI foundation
Add heavy AI libraries gradually
Use fallback approach for stability
Monitor performance carefully
