# Level 3 SCIN Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T06:19:35.702652

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy Level 3 SCIN capabilities with real dataset integration

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Core AI: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV (proven working)
- Level 2 AI: FAISS, TIMM, Transformers, PyTorch (proven working)
- Level 3 SCIN: Google Cloud Storage, SCIN dataset (NEW)
- Optimized for m5.2xlarge (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
- Real-world skin analysis capabilities

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Level 3 SCIN capabilities with fallbacks
- requirements.txt: SCIN dataset dependencies enabled
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration (1 worker, 120s timeout)
- .ebextensions: m5.2xlarge configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for successful deployment
3. Verify SCIN dataset integration working
4. Test real-world analysis features

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Environment deploys successfully
- SCIN dataset integration loads without errors
- Real-world analysis completing
- Memory usage within 32GB limits

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Build on proven Level 2 AI foundation
Add SCIN dataset integration gradually
Use fallback approach for stability
Monitor performance carefully
