# Level 4 Full AI Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T06:36:30.404245

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy Level 4 Full AI capabilities with custom models and real-time analysis

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Core AI: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV (proven working)
- Level 2 AI: FAISS, TIMM, Transformers, PyTorch (proven working)
- Level 3 SCIN: Google Cloud Storage, SCIN dataset (proven working)
- Level 4 Full AI: Custom models, real-time analysis (NEW)
- Optimized for m5.2xlarge (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
- Production-ready AI platform

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Level 4 Full AI capabilities with fallbacks
- requirements.txt: Custom model dependencies enabled
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration (1 worker, 120s timeout)
- .ebextensions: m5.2xlarge configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for successful deployment
3. Verify custom models working
4. Test real-time analysis features

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Environment deploys successfully
- Custom models load without errors
- Real-time analysis completing
- Memory usage within 32GB limits

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
