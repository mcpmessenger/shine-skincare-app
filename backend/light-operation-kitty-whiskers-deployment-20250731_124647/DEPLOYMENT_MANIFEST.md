# Light Operation Kitty Whiskers Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T12:46:47.016528

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy Light Operation Kitty Whiskers with minimal dependencies to avoid hanging

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Core AI: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV (proven working)
- Light Operation Kitty Whiskers: Supabase auth, medical analysis, facial matrix
- Optimized for m5.2xlarge (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
- Production-ready AI platform with authentication
- Minimal dependencies for fast deployment

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Light Operation Kitty Whiskers capabilities with fallbacks
- requirements.txt: Minimal dependencies (no heavy AI libraries)
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration (1 worker, 120s timeout)
- .ebextensions: m5.2xlarge configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Configure Supabase environment variables
3. Monitor for successful deployment (should be fast)
4. Verify medical analysis working
5. Test authentication flow

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Environment deploys successfully (no hanging)
- Supabase integration working
- Medical analysis completing
- Memory usage within 32GB limits

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Build on proven Level 4 foundation
Use minimal dependencies to avoid hanging
Add Supabase authentication
Add medical analysis capabilities
Use fallback approach for stability
Monitor performance carefully
