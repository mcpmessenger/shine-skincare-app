# Minimal AI Deployment Manifest
# Created: 2025-07-31T05:28:57.001287

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
Deploy with minimal AI services within t3.micro environment constraints

## ðŸ”§ FEATURES
- Minimal AI models (NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV)
- Optimized for t3.micro (1GB RAM)
- Gradual loading with fallbacks
- Basic AI analysis with minimal resources
- Builds on proven stable approach

## ðŸ“¦ CONTENTS
- application.py: Minimal AI services
- requirements.txt: Minimal AI dependencies
- Procfile: Gunicorn configuration
- .ebextensions: Minimal configuration

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT
1. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk
2. Monitor for AI model loading
3. Test minimal AI services

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Core AI libraries load successfully
- Minimal memory usage (< 500MB)
- Basic AI analysis working
- Stable deployment in t3.micro

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY
Build on proven stable approach
Use minimal AI libraries only
Optimize for memory constraints
Monitor performance and stability
