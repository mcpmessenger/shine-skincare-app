# ML Model Upgrade Execution Plan

## 🎯 **Overview**
This plan executes the comprehensive ML model upgrades outlined in `ML Model.md` to address the current challenges in the Shine Skincare App.

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**
- ✅ Backend API working with Flask
- ✅ Face detection system operational
- ✅ Multiple datasets available (HAM10000, ISIC2020, DermNet, etc.)
- ❌ Condition detection accuracy ~25% (target: >80%)
- ❌ Embeddings not distinctive enough
- ❌ Image characteristics analysis too insensitive

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

### **Step 1.1: Download Required Datasets**
- [ ] Download UTKFace dataset for healthy face corpus
- [ ] Download ASCID dataset for skin conditions
- [ ] Download DDI dataset for demographic diversity
- [ ] Verify dataset integrity and licensing

### **Step 1.2: Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
- [ ] Create unified data structure
- [ ] Implement image normalization (224x224, 0-1 range)
- [ ] Standardize demographic labels
- [ ] Map condition labels to consistent set
- [ ] Implement stratified data splitting (70/15/15)

### **Step 1.3: Data Augmentation**
- [ ] Geometric transformations (rotation, shift, flip, zoom)
- [ ] Color jittering (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- [ ] Occlusion simulation
- [ ] Synthetic data generation for underrepresented groups

## 🏗️ **Phase 2: Model Architecture Implementation**

### **Step 2.1: CNN Backbone**
- [ ] Implement pre-trained ResNet50/EfficientNetB4
- [ ] Add transfer learning capabilities
- [ ] Configure feature extraction layers

### **Step 2.2: Multi-Task Learning Heads**
- [ ] Skin Condition Classification Head
- [ ] Demographic Attribute Prediction Head
- [ ] Skin Characteristic Regression Head
- [ ] Embedding Generation Head (with contrastive loss)

### **Step 2.3: Attention Mechanisms**
- [ ] Implement Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks
- [ ] Add Convolutional Block Attention Module
- [ ] Create attention visualization capabilities

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Training and Validation**

### **Step 3.1: Training Pipeline**
- [ ] Implement composite loss function
- [ ] Set up Adam/SGD optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Add regularization (Dropout, L1/L2)
- [ ] Implement early stopping

### **Step 3.2: Bias Mitigation**
- [ ] Fairness-aware data sampling
- [ ] Adversarial debiasing (optional)
- [ ] Fairness metrics monitoring

### **Step 3.3: Validation Framework**
- [ ] Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1, specificity)
- [ ] Demographic fairness metrics
- [ ] Embedding distinctiveness metrics
- [ ] Cross-validation setup

## 📈 **Phase 4: Integration and Deployment**

### **Step 4.1: API Integration**
- [ ] Update Flask backend to use new model
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Add model versioning

### **Step 4.2: Frontend Updates**
- [ ] Update Next.js frontend for new API responses
- [ ] Add enhanced visualization capabilities
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring display

### **Step 4.3: Deployment**
- [ ] Model quantization for mobile optimization
- [ ] AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Target Performance**
- 🎯 Condition detection accuracy: >80%
- 🎯 Acne detection: >90% for acne images
- 🎯 False positive rate: <10%
- 🎯 Demographic fairness: <5% performance gap
- 🎯 Embedding distinctiveness: >0.8 inter-class separation

### **Current Performance**
- ❌ Condition detection accuracy: ~25%
- ❌ Acne detection: Failing
- ❌ Embeddings similarity: ~0.25 (should be much lower)
