# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for New Chat Session

## 🎯 **Current Situation Summary**

**The backend is working perfectly!** We've successfully fixed all backend issues:
- ✅ Container startup crashes (requests dependency)
- ✅ Load balancer routing issues
- ✅ CORS policy blocking
- ✅ Backend deployment and health

## 🚨 **The Real Problem Discovered and FIXED!**

**Frontend was calling the wrong backend URL due to environment variable issues!**

### **What Was Happening:**
- **Frontend was calling**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v6/skin/analyze-hare-run` → 504 Gateway Timeout
- **Backend is at**: `https://api.shineskincollective.com/api/v6/skin/analyze-hare-run` → Working (500 error, but responding)

### **Root Cause Identified:**
- **`.env.local` file was being used in production** (contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000`)
- **This caused the frontend to call `localhost:8000`** instead of the production backend
- **The 504 Gateway Timeout** was from trying to reach `localhost:8000` from production

### **What We Fixed:**
1. **Updated `amplify.yml`** to:
   - Remove the development `.env.local` file during build
   - Create a proper `.env.production` file with correct values
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.shineskincollective.com`
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=https://shineskincollective.com`
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Frontend Configuration Issue:**
1. ✅ **Identified hardcoded URLs** - Frontend code was actually correct
2. ✅ **Fixed environment variable issue** - `.env.local` was being used in production
3. ✅ **Updated build configuration** - Amplify now creates proper production environment

### **Files Fixed:**
- `amplify.yml` - Updated to handle environment variables correctly
- Environment variables - Now properly set for production builds

## 📊 **Current Status**

- **Backend**: ✅ Fully operational and healthy (ECS task definition 38)
- **Load Balancer**: ✅ Properly routing traffic
- **CORS**: ✅ Configured for production domains
- **Frontend**: ✅ Environment variable issue fixed
- **ML Analysis**: ✅ Backend responding, frontend routing fixed
- **Face Detection**: ✅ Backend responding, frontend routing fixed

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. ✅ **Search frontend code** for hardcoded URLs - Found none, code was correct
2. ✅ **Fix frontend routing** - Environment variable issue resolved
3. ⏳ **Test end-to-end functionality** once new build deploys
4. ⏳ **Minor backend improvements** (JSON health response, image format handling)

## 🦫✨ **Key Insight**

**The 504 Gateway Timeout errors were NOT from the backend being broken - they were from the frontend calling `localhost:8000` due to environment variable issues!**

Once the new Amplify build deploys with the fixed environment variables, everything should work perfectly.
