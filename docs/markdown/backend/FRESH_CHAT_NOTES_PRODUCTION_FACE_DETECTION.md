# Production Face Detection Issue - ALB Configuration Confusion Identified

## Current Status: August 15, 2025
**Issue: ALB Configuration Confusion - Working on Wrong Load Balancer**

## What We Discovered
- ❌ **ALB Mismatch**: Domain points to different ALB than the one we configured
- ❌ **Port Configuration**: Target group port mismatch (5000 vs 8000) 
- ❌ **Traffic Flow**: Requests never reach our configured infrastructure
- ✅ **ECS Health**: Container is running and healthy on port 8000
- ✅ **Security Groups**: Port 8000 access configured

## Current Architecture Status
- ✅ **ECS Service**: Running with Task Definition Revision 23
- ✅ **Container Image**: `shine-api-gateway:hare-run-v6` with lazy loading
- ✅ **Container Health**: ECS tasks running and healthy on port 8000
- ❌ **ALB Configuration**: Working on wrong load balancer
- ❌ **DNS Routing**: Domain points to different ALB than configured

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: ALB Configuration Confusion

**Root Cause**: We've been configuring `production-shine-skincare-alb` but the domain `api.shineskincollective.com` points to a different load balancer.

**Evidence**:
- **Domain DNS**: `api.shineskincollective.com` → `34.236.195.89, 54.144.69.207, etc.`
- **Configured ALB**: `production-shine-skincare-alb-1879927784.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Result**: Traffic never reaches our configured infrastructure

**What We Fixed (on wrong ALB)**:
1. ✅ Security group rules for port 8000
2. ✅ Target group configuration (port 8000)
3. ✅ ALB listener configuration (HTTP:8000)
4. ✅ ECS target registration

**What Still Needs Fixing**:
1. ❌ **Identify correct ALB**: Find which ALB the domain actually points to
2. ❌ **Configure correct ALB**: Apply fixes to the ALB that receives traffic
3. ❌ **Verify DNS routing**: Ensure domain points to configured ALB

## Immediate Action Required
1. ✅ **Infrastructure Analysis**: Identified ALB configuration confusion
2. 🔄 **Correct ALB Identification**: Find which ALB receives domain traffic
3. 🔄 **Configuration Transfer**: Apply fixes to correct ALB
4. 🔄 **DNS Verification**: Confirm routing to configured ALB

## Resolution Progress
1. ✅ **Container Issues**: Fixed lazy loading and environment variables
2. ✅ **Network Connectivity**: ALB can reach ECS containers
3. ✅ **Port Configuration**: Aligned all components to use port 8000
4. ✅ **Security Groups**: Port 8000 access configured
5. ❌ **ALB Configuration**: Working on wrong load balancer
6. 🔄 **Next Step**: Configure the ALB that actually receives traffic

## Next Actions
- [ ] Identify which ALB `api.shineskincollective.com` actually points to
- [ ] Apply port 8000 configuration to the correct ALB
- [ ] Verify traffic flow from domain → ALB → Target Group → ECS
- [ ] Test production face detection with correct configuration
- [ ] Update documentation with final working configuration

## Current Status: 70% RESOLVED - ALB Configuration Confusion
**Infrastructure configured but on wrong load balancer - need to identify and configure correct ALB**
