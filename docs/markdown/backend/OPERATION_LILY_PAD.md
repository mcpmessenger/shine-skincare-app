## **📝 COMMIT MESSAGE TO USE:**
```
🐸 FROG BRANCH v1.0.1 - SSL CERTIFICATE ISSUE IDENTIFIED & SOLUTION FOUND 🐸

✅ Hare Run V6 integration working
✅ Product recommendations display with images
✅ Add to cart functionality integrated
✅ Products show in recommendations section
✅ Fallback to general products if no matches
✅ Clean production code - no debug sections
✅ All hardcoded localhost URLs replaced with production backend
