## 🎯 **THE REAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **Issue**: DNS Routing Mismatch ✅ RESOLVED
Your domain `api.shineskincollective.com` was pointing to the **WRONG load balancer**.

**Previous (BROKEN)**:
```
api.shineskincollective.com → Elastic Beanstalk ALB (awseb--AWSEB-ydAUJ3jj2fwA)
    ↓
Target Group: shine-api-tg-eb-8000 (UNHEALTHY)
    ↓
ECS Container: 172.31.14.122:8000 (TIMEOUT)
```

**Current (WORKING)**:
```
api.shineskincollection.com → Production ALB (production-shine-skincare-alb)
    ↓
Target Group: shine-api-tg-8000-fixed (HEALTHY)
    ↓
ECS Container: 172.31.14.122:8000 (HEALTHY)
```

## 📝 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **What We Discovered**
1. **Infrastructure was mostly correct** - just DNS routing issue
2. **Security groups needed fine-tuning** - ALB-ECS communication rules
3. **Multiple ALBs exist** - need to route to the working one
4. **Target groups can be healthy** while traffic routing fails
5. **CORS configuration missing** - frontend can't access API endpoints
6. **API version mismatches** - frontend calling endpoints that don't exist

### **What We Fixed**
1. **Security group connectivity** - ALB can now reach ECS
2. **Listener rule configuration** - proper HTTPS routing
3. **Target group identification** - found working configuration
4. **Network configuration** - resolved all connectivity issues
5. **DNS routing** - domain now points to working ALB
6. **CORS configuration** - added proper cross-origin headers
7. **API endpoints** - added missing V4 endpoints
