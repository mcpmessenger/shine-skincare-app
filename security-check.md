# Security Check Before GitHub Push

## ✅ SAFE TO PUSH - All sensitive files are protected

### Files with Real Credentials (Protected by .gitignore):
- `shine-466907-09b8909d49ec.json` ✅ In gitignore
- `.env.vercel` ✅ In gitignore  
- `.env.local` ✅ In gitignore

### Files Sanitized (Safe for GitHub):
- `.env` ✅ Credentials removed
- Railway deployment files removed (migrated to AWS EB)

### AWS EB Backend URL for Amplify:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://Shine-backend-poc-env.eba-bpcnncyq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://Shine-backend-poc-env.eba-bpcnncyq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

## Next Steps:
1. ✅ Push to GitHub (safe)

3. ✅ Redeploy frontend
4. ✅ Test integration

## AWS EB Backend Status:
