# ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `shine-skincare-app`
   - **Description**: `AI-Powered Skincare App with Cart & Stripe Integration`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shine-skincare-app.git

# Set the main branch (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository URL
2. You should see all the files we created
3. The repository should show:
   - README.md with project documentation
   - All source code files
   - .gitignore file
   - Environment example files

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Features (Optional)

### GitHub Pages (for demo)
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main, folder: / (root)
4. Save

### GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)
1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing
2. Set up deployment workflows

### Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Require pull request reviews
4. Require status checks to pass

## Step 5: Share Your Repository

Your repository is now ready to share! You can:

- Share the GitHub URL with others
